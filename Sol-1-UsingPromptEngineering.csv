Here’s the story you haven’t heard.,"Part Three: Fuel and emissions Now that we have an estimate of the total energy required to run an AI model to produce text, images, and videos, we can work out what that means in terms of emissions that cause climate change. First, a data center humming away isn’t necessarily a bad thing. If all data centers were hooked up to solar panels and ran only when the sun was shining, the world would be talking a lot less about AI’s energy consumption. That’s not the case. Most electrical grids around the world are still heavily reliant on fossil fuels. So electricity use comes with a climate toll attached. “AI data centers need constant power, 24-7, 365 days a year,” says Rahul Mewawalla, the CEO of Mawson Infrastructure Group, which builds and maintains high-energy data centers that support AI. That means data centers can’t rely on intermittent technologies like wind and solar power, and on average, they tend to use dirtier electricity. One preprint study from Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that the carbon intensity of electricity used by data centers was 48% higher than the US average. Part of the reason is that data centers currently happen to be clustered in places that have dirtier grids on average, like the coal-heavy grid in the mid-Atlantic region that includes Virginia, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania. They also run constantly, including when cleaner sources may not be available. Data centers can’t rely on intermittent technologies like wind and solar power, and on average, they tend to use dirtier electricity. Tech companies like Meta, Amazon, and Google have responded to this fossil fuel issue by announcing goals to use more nuclear power. Those three have joined a pledge to triple the world’s nuclear capacity by 2025. But today, nuclear energy only accounts for 20% of electricity supply in the US, and powers a fraction of AI data centers’ operations—natural gas accounts for more than half of electricity generated in Virginia, which has more data centers than any other US state, for example. What’s more, new nuclear operations will take years, perhaps decades, to materialize. In 2024, fossil fuels including natural gas and coal made up just under 60% of electricity supply in the US. Nuclear accounted for about 20%, and a mix of renewables accounted for most of the remaining 20%. Gaps in power supply, combined with the rush to build data centers to power AI, often mean shortsighted energy plans. In April, Elon Musk’s X supercomputing center near Memphis was found, via satellite imagery, to be using dozens of methane gas generators that the Southern Environmental Law Center alleges are not approved by energy regulators to supplement grid power and are violating the Clean Air Act. The key metric used to quantify the emissions from these data centers is called the carbon intensity: how many grams of carbon dioxide emissions are produced for each kilowatt-hour of electricity consumed. Nailing down the carbon intensity of a given grid requires understanding the emissions produced by each individual power plant in operation, along with the amount of energy each is contributing to the grid at any given time. Utilities, government agencies, and researchers use estimates of average emissions, as well as real-time measurements, to track pollution from power plants. This intensity varies widely across regions. The US grid is fragmented, and the mixes of coal, gas, renewables, or nuclear vary widely. California’s grid is far cleaner than West Virginia’s, for example. Time of day matters too. For instance, data from April 2024 shows that California’s grid can swing from under 70 grams per kilowatt-hour in the afternoon when there’s a lot of solar power available to over 300 grams per kilowatt-hour in the middle of the night. This variability means that the same activity may have very different climate impacts, depending on your location and the time you make a request. Take that charity marathon runner, for example. The text, image, and video responses they requested add up to 2.9 kilowatt-hours of electricity. In California, generating that amount of electricity would produce about 650 grams of carbon dioxide pollution on average. But generating that electricity in West Virginia might inflate the total to more than 1,150 grams. AI around the corner What we’ve seen so far is that the energy required to respond to a query can be relatively small, but it can vary a lot, depending on the type of query and the model being used. The emissions associated with that given amount of electricity will also depend on where and when a query is handled. But what does this all add up to? ChatGPT is now estimated to be the fifth-most visited website in the world, just after Instagram and ahead of X. In December, OpenAI said that ChatGPT receives 1 billion messages every day, and after the company launched a new image generator in March, it said that people were using it to generate 78 million images per day, from Studio Ghibli–style portraits to pictures of themselves as Barbie dolls. Given the direction AI is headed—more personalized, able to reason and solve complex problems on our behalf, and everywhere we look—it’s likely that our AI footprint today is the smallest it will ever be. One can do some very rough math to estimate the energy impact. In February the AI research firm Epoch AI published an estimate of how much energy is used for a single ChatGPT query—an estimate that, as discussed, makes lots of assumptions that can’t be verified. Still, they calculated about 0.3 watt-hours, or 1,080 joules, per message. This falls in between our estimates for the smallest and largest Meta Llama models (and experts we consulted say that if anything, the real number is likely higher, not lower). One billion of these every day for a year would mean over 109 gigawatt-hours of electricity, enough to power 10,400 US homes for a year. If we add images and imagine that generating each one requires as much energy as it does with our high-quality image models, it’d mean an additional 35 gigawatt-hours, enough to power another 3,300 homes for a year. This is on top of the energy demands of OpenAI’s other products, like video generators, and that for all the other AI companies and startups. But here’s the problem: These estimates don’t capture the near future of how we’ll use AI. In that future, we won’t simply ping AI models with a question or two throughout the day, or have them generate a photo. Instead, leading labs are racing us toward a world where AI “agents” perform tasks for us without our supervising their every move. We will speak to models in voice mode, chat with companions for 2 hours a day, and point our phone cameras at our surroundings in video mode. We will give complex tasks to so-called “reasoning models” that work through tasks logically but have been found to require 43 times more energy for simple problems, or “deep research” models that spend hours creating reports for us. We will have AI models that are “personalized” by training on our data and preferences. This future is around the corner: OpenAI will reportedly offer agents for $20,000 per month and will use reasoning capabilities in all of its models moving forward, and DeepSeek catapulted “chain of thought” reasoning into the mainstream with a model that often generates nine pages of text for each response. AI models are being added to everything from customer service phone lines to doctor’s offices, rapidly increasing AI’s share of national energy consumption. “The precious few numbers that we have may shed a tiny sliver of light on where we stand right now, but all bets are off in the coming years,” says Luccioni. Every researcher we spoke to said that we cannot understand the energy demands of this future by simply extrapolating from the energy used in AI queries today. And indeed, the moves by leading AI companies to fire up nuclear power plants and create data centers of unprecedented scale suggest that their vision for the future would consume far more energy than even a large number of these individual queries. “The precious few numbers that we have may shed a tiny sliver of light on where we stand right now, but all bets are off in the coming years,” says Luccioni. “Generative AI tools are getting practically shoved down our throats and it’s getting harder and harder to opt out, or to make informed choices when it comes to energy and climate.” To understand how much power this AI revolution will need, and where it will come from, we have to read between the lines.","['Technology', 'Environment', 'Economy']","AI's Carbon Footprint: Is Our Tech Revolution Cooking the Planet?
","The energy consumption of AI, particularly large language models and image generators, is significant and its carbon footprint is heavily influenced by the energy sources powering data centers.  These centers, often located in areas with high fossil fuel reliance, operate continuously, making them dependent on non-renewable sources and resulting in higher carbon intensity compared to national averages.  Future AI applications, involving more complex tasks and personalized models, promise exponentially higher energy demands, making current estimates of the climate impact vastly inadequate. ","The article's key insights and takeaways center on the significant and rapidly growing energy consumption and carbon emissions associated with artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI models like ChatGPT.  Here's a breakdown:

**1.  Current AI Energy Consumption is High and Dirty:**

* Data centers powering AI run constantly, requiring significant energy, and they're often located in areas with electricity grids heavily reliant on fossil fuels (coal and natural gas). This results in higher-than-average carbon intensity compared to the overall national average.  Even efforts by tech giants to utilize nuclear power are currently limited and won't solve the immediate problem.

**2.  Carbon Intensity Varies Significantly:**

* The carbon footprint of an AI query depends heavily on the location and time of the request.  A query processed in a state with a clean energy grid (e.g., California) will have a much smaller carbon footprint than one processed in a state with a dirtier grid (e.g., West Virginia).  Time of day also matters due to variations in renewable energy sources' availability.

**3.  Current Estimates are a Gross Underestimation of Future Needs:**

* Existing calculations of AI's energy consumption are based on current usage patterns (simple queries, image generation).  The future of AI involves far more energy-intensive applications: AI agents performing complex tasks, extended voice and video interactions, and sophisticated reasoning models that require exponentially more energy.  Extrapolating from current data drastically underestimates future energy demands.

**4.  Lack of Transparency and Regulation:**

* The article highlights a lack of transparency around energy usage, particularly citing examples of data centers using unapproved methane generators, suggesting a need for stronger regulations and monitoring.

**5.  The Unchecked Growth of AI Poses a Significant Climate Threat:**

* The explosive growth of AI, driven by companies pushing increasingly complex models and applications, is accelerating energy consumption without sufficient attention to its environmental consequences. The authors express concern about the lack of user choice and control over the environmental impact of their AI interactions.

**In short:** The article warns that the current energy consumption and carbon emissions associated with AI are substantial and are poised to explode in the coming years.  Addressing this requires immediate action, including a shift to cleaner energy sources for data centers, stricter regulation of energy usage in the AI sector, and greater transparency around the environmental footprint of AI services.  Simply extrapolating current trends is insufficient; the future implications are far more significant and alarming.

Unveiled Tuesday at the search giant's annual Google I/O developer conference, AI Mode comes a year after the company introduced AI Overviews, its first tool to use generative AI technology to enhance its search engine capabilities. Sundar Pichai, CEO of both Google and parent company,Alphabet, said in remarks at the conference that AI Mode represents a ""total reimagining of Search"" and that it would gradually be rolled out to all Google users. ""What all this progress means is that we are in a new phase of the AI platform shift, where decades of research are now becoming reality for people all over the world,"" Pichai told the crowd yesterday at an amphitheater near the company's headquarters in Mountain View, California, according to the Associated Press. A video teasing the technology showcases how it works. In response to lengthy, detailed questions typed into Google search, AI Mode displays how many searches Google is performing and how many sites it's scanning as the technology quickly generates a summarized response at the top of the search platform. It also provides a side bar with links to relevant sites. Google said it's also testing a ""Search Live"" feature that will enable the search engine to respond to questions based on video content, as well as voice searches, or to questions verbalized by the user, rather than typed. As an example, Google's teaser shows a person recording a video of themselves holding a bridge made of Popsicle sticks while asking the search engine what can be done to strengthen the structure. ""To make it stronger, consider adding more triangles to the design,"" an automated voice responds. Google said it will begin feeding its latest AI model, Gemini 2.5, into its search engine starting next week. The company calls Gemini 2.5 its ""most intelligent model"" yet. Rapid advancements The California-based company began testing AI Mode in March of this year. Google's latest AI search tool builds on AI Overviews, which was introduced in the U.S. in May 2024 and has 1.5 billion users, according to an article on the Google website. Some argue that AI Overviews, which provides an AI-generated summary of information online, at times eliminating the need to click directly on source links for further information, has undercut traffic to their sites. According to a study by Ahrefs, AI Overviews led to a 35% lower average click-through rates for top-ranking pages on search engine results pages. Concerns over accuracy ""By making AI Mode a core part of the experience, Google is betting it can cater to the demand for AI without alienating its massive base,"" Gadjo Sevilla, a senior analyst for research firm eMarketer, wrote in a blog post. ""But there are risks for hallucinations and factual errors which could drive users towards competitors,"" he added. Such factual errors were spotted with AI Overviews soon after its release, prompting Google to admit in a statement at the time that the technology produced ""some odd and erroneous overviews."" In one instance, AI Overviews suggested that users add glue to pizza or eat at least one small rock a day, according to the MIT Technology Review. As for AI Mode, Google has indicated that its new AI search tech is performing well and serving its intended purpose. ""We conduct quantitative research and collect in-product feedback to ask users whether they're satisfied with their results. And we've seen that introducing AI Overviews on Search leads to an increase in satisfaction and reported helpfulness,"" a Google spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch.","['Technology', 'Business', 'Finance']","Google's AI Revolution:  Is This the End of Search as We Know It?
","Google launched AI Mode, a new search feature offering detailed, summarized responses to complex queries, building upon its previous AI Overviews tool.  This represents a significant overhaul of Google Search, utilizing their most advanced AI model, Gemini 2.5, and incorporating features like ""Search Live"" for video and voice-based searches.  While promising enhanced user experience, concerns remain regarding potential inaccuracies and the impact on website traffic. ","Key Insights and Takeaways from the Article:

* **Google's AI Push:** Google is aggressively integrating AI into its core search function, aiming for a ""total reimagining of Search.""  This is evidenced by the launch of AI Mode, building upon the previously released AI Overviews.  The rollout of Gemini 2.5, their ""most intelligent model,"" further underscores this commitment.

* **Impact on Users and Websites:** While AI Mode aims to enhance user experience, it raises concerns about the impact on website traffic. AI Overviews, a precursor to AI Mode, has already been shown to decrease click-through rates to websites by 35%, potentially harming website owners' revenue.  This highlights a tension between improved user experience and the economic interests of content creators.

* **Accuracy Concerns:**  A significant risk associated with AI-powered search is the potential for inaccuracies (""hallucinations"").  AI Overviews suffered from this issue early on, raising concerns about the reliability of AI Mode.  While Google claims AI Mode is performing well, the potential for factual errors remains a significant challenge.

* **Google's Strategy and Risks:** Google is betting that AI Mode can satisfy user demand for AI-powered search without alienating its user base.  However, the risk of inaccuracies and the potential negative impact on website traffic could drive users to competitors.  The success of AI Mode hinges on balancing user experience with the accuracy and reliability of the AI technology.

2,https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/22/1117277/ai-energy-three-takeaways/,Three takeaways about AI’s energy use and climate impacts,"We found that the same exact query, with the same exact energy demand, will have a very different climate impact depending on what the data center is powered by, and that depends on the location and the time of day. For example, querying a data center in West Virginia could cause nearly twice the emissions of querying one in California, according to calculations based on average data from 2024. This point shows why it matters where tech giants are building data centers, what the grid looks like in their chosen locations, and how that might change with more demand from the new infrastructure. 3. There is still so much that we don't know when it comes to AI and energy. Our reporting resulted in estimates that are some of the most specific and comprehensive out there. But ultimately, we still have no idea what many of the biggest, most influential models are adding up to in terms of energy and emissions. None of the companies we reached out to were willing to provide numbers during our reporting. Not one. Adding up our estimates can only go so far, in part because AI is increasingly everywhere. While today you might generally have to go to a dedicated site and type in questions, in the future AI could be stitched into the fabric of our interactions with technology. (See my colleague Will Douglas Heaven’s new story on Google’s I/O showcase: “By putting AI into everything, Google wants to make it invisible.”) AI could be one of the major forces that shape our society, our work, and our power grid. Knowing more about its consequences could be crucial to planning our future. To dig into our reporting, give the main story a read.

3,https://news.mit.edu/2025/new-technology-extends-produce-shelf-life-0521,A new technology for extending the shelf life of produce,"We’ve all felt the sting of guilt when fruit and vegetables go bad before we could eat them. Now, researchers from MIT and the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART) have shown they can extend the shelf life of harvested plants by injecting them with melatonin using biodegradable microneedles. That’s a big deal because the problem of food waste goes way beyond our salads. More than 30 percent of the world’s food is lost after it’s harvested — enough to feed more than 1 billion people. Refrigeration is the most common way to preserve foods, but it requires energy and infrastructure that many regions of the world can’t afford or lack access to. The researchers believe their system could offer an alternative or complement to refrigeration. Central to their approach are patches of silk microneedles. The microneedles can get through the tough, waxy skin of plants without causing a stress response, and deliver precise amounts of melatonin into plants’ inner tissues. “This is the first time that we’ve been able to apply these microneedles to extend the shelf life of a fresh-cut crop,” says Benedetto Marelli, the study’s senior author, associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at MIT, and the director of the Wild Cards mission of the MIT Climate Project. “We thought we could use this technology to deliver something that could regulate or control the plant’s post-harvest physiology. Eventually, we looked at hormones, and melatonin is already used by plants to regulate such functions. The food we waste could feed about 1.6 billion people. Even in the U.S., this approach could one day expand access to healthy foods.” For the study, which appears today in Nano Letters, Marelli and researchers from SMART applied small patches of the microneedles containing melatonin to the base of the leafy vegetable pak choy. After application, the researchers found the melatonin was able to extend the vegetables’ shelf life by four days at room temperature and 10 days when refrigerated, which could allow more crops to reach consumers before they’re wasted. “Post-harvest waste is a huge issue. This problem is extremely important in emerging markets around Africa and Southeast Asia, where many crops are produced but can't be maintained in the journey from farms to markets,” says Sarojam Rajani, co-senior author of the study and a senior principal investigator at the Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory in Singapore. Plant destressors For years, Marelli’s lab has been exploring the use of silk microneedles for things like delivering nutrients to crops and monitoring plant health. Microneedles made from silk fibroin protein are nontoxic and biodegradable, and Marelli’s previous work has described ways of manufacturing them at scale. To test microneedle’s ability to extend the shelf life of food, the researchers wanted to study their ability to deliver a hormone known to affect the senescence process. Aside from helping humans sleep, melatonin is also a natural hormone in many plants that helps them regulate growth and aging. “The dose of melatonin we’re delivering is so low that it’s fully metabolized by the crops, so it would not significantly increase the amount of melatonin normally present in the food; we would not ingest more melatonin than usual,” Marelli says. “We chose pak choy because it's a very important crop in Asia, and also because pak choy is very perishable.” Pak choy is typically harvested by cutting the leafy plant from the root system, exposing the shoot base that provides easy access to vascular bundles which distribute water and nutrients to the rest of the plant. To begin their study, the researchers first used their microneedles to inject a fluorescent dye into the base to confirm that vasculature could spread the dye throughout the plant. The researchers then compared the shelf life of regular pak choy plants and plants that had been sprayed with or dipped into melatonin, finding no difference. With their baseline shelf life established, the researchers applied small patches of the melatonin-filled microneedles to the bottom of pak choy plants by hand. They then stored the treated plants, along with controls, in plastic boxes both at room temperature and under refrigeration. The team evaluated the plants by monitoring their weight, visual appearance, and concentration of chlorophyll, a green pigment that decreases as plants age. At room temperature, the leaves of the untreated control group began yellowing within two or three days. By the fourth day, the yellowing accelerated to the point that the plants likely could not be sold. Plants treated with the melatonin-loaded silk microneedles, in contrast, remained green on day five, and the yellowing process was significantly delayed. The weight loss and chlorophyll reduction of treated plants also slowed significantly at room temperature. Overall, the researchers estimated the microneedle-treated plants retained their saleable value until the eighth day. “We clearly saw we could enhance the shelf life of pak choy without the cold chain,” Marelli says. In refrigerated conditions of about 40 degrees Fahrenheit, plant yellowing was delayed by about five days on average, with treated plants remaining relatively green until day 25. “Spectrophotometric analysis of the plants indicated the treated plants had higher antioxidant activity, while gene analysis showed the melatonin set off a protective chain reaction inside the plants, preserving chlorophyll and adjusting hormones to slow senescence,” says Monika Jangir, co-first author and former postdoc at the Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory. “We studied melatonin’s effects and saw it improves the stress response of the plant after it’s been cut, so it’s basically decreasing the stress that plant’s experience, and that extends its shelf life,” says Yangyang Han, co-first author and research scientist at the Disruptive and Sustainable Technologies for Agricultural Precision (DiSTAP) interdisciplinary research group at SMART. Toward postharvest preservation While the microneedles could make it possible to minimize waste when compared to other application methods like spraying or dipping crops, the researchers say more work is needed to deploy microneedles at scale. For instance, although the researchers applied the microneedle patches by hand in this experiment, the patches could be applied using tractors, autonomous drones, and other farming equipment in the future. “For this to be widely adopted, we’d need to reach a performance versus cost threshold to justify its use,” Marelli explains. “This method would need to become cheap enough to be used by farmers regularly.” Moving forward, the research team plans to study the effects of a variety of hormones on different crops using its microneedle delivery technology. The team believes the technique should work with all kinds of produce. “We’re going to continue to analyze how we can increase the impact this can have on the value and quality of crops,” Marelli says. “For example, could this let us modulate the nutritional values of the crop, how it’s shaped, its texture, etc.? We're also going to continue looking into scaling up the technology so this can be used in the field.” The work was supported by the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART) and the National Research Foundation of Singapore.","['Science', 'Technology', 'Environment']","Microneedles: The Tiny Pricks That Could End Food Waste?
","MIT and Singapore-MIT researchers have developed biodegradable microneedles that inject melatonin into harvested plants, extending their shelf life by several days at room temperature and even longer when refrigerated.  This innovative approach, detailed in *Nano Letters*, addresses significant post-harvest food waste—a problem impacting billions—by offering a low-cost, energy-efficient alternative or supplement to refrigeration, particularly beneficial in resource-limited regions.  The microneedles effectively deliver the plant hormone melatonin, slowing down the aging process and maintaining the quality of the produce. ","Key Insights and Takeaways from the Article:

* **Significant Food Waste Problem:**  A major global issue is the post-harvest loss of food, exceeding 30% of the total produced – enough to feed over a billion people.  This is particularly problematic in developing nations lacking refrigeration infrastructure.

* **Melatonin Microneedle Solution:** Researchers have developed a novel method to extend the shelf life of harvested plants using biodegradable silk microneedles to deliver melatonin directly into the plant tissue.  This addresses the need for alternatives to refrigeration.

* **Mechanism of Action:** Melatonin, a hormone naturally occurring in plants, regulates growth and aging.  The microneedles effectively deliver a low dose, which is metabolized by the plant, triggering a protective response that slows senescence (aging) and improves stress response after harvest.  This results in delayed yellowing and weight loss.

* **Successful Pak Choy Experiment:**  Experiments on pak choy demonstrated a significant extension in shelf life: four extra days at room temperature and ten extra days under refrigeration. This was superior to simply spraying or dipping the plants in melatonin.

* **Technological Advantages:** Silk microneedles are non-toxic, biodegradable, and can penetrate plant skin without causing damage, enabling precise melatonin delivery.  Previous research has shown scalability of microneedle production.

* **Future Directions & Challenges:** While promising, scaling up the technology for widespread agricultural use remains a challenge.  Further research is needed to optimize cost-effectiveness and explore the application across diverse crops and potential impacts on nutritional value and other crop characteristics.  The researchers plan to investigate different hormones and their effects on various produce.


In short, the article presents a promising technological solution to a significant global problem.  The use of melatonin-delivering silk microneedles offers a potential environmentally friendly and cost-effective way to reduce food waste, especially in regions lacking sufficient refrigeration infrastructure.  However, further development and scaling are necessary for widespread implementation.

5,https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/05/rhow-technology-practitioners-can-drive-environmental-stewardship/,How technology practitioners can embed sustainability,"Writing efficient code allows technologists to reduce energy usage and drive environmental sustainability at the source. Choosing renewable-powered infrastructure helps to shrink the footprint of operations. Collaborating openly and educating broadly enables building a movement capable of reshaping industry norms. As the digital economy accelerates, so too does its environmental impact. Technology practitioners, from engineers and designers to product managers and data scientists, are increasingly recognized as key actors in the global transition towards sustainable development. From optimizing the code that powers our applications to rethinking the energy sources behind our cloud infrastructure, the choices made by technologists today are relevant for a greener and energy-efficient future. With the global energy crisis and climate change being some of the defining challenges of our time, incorporating environmental stewardship into digital innovation is no longer optional; it is essential. Responsible innovation means designing and deploying technologies that solve problems and safeguard the planet. There are three critical levers technology practitioners can pull to drive sustainable impact: Code efficiency. Renewable-powered infrastructure. Community collaboration through open-source development and sustainability education. Sustainable software engineering Software may be intangible but its environmental cost is very real. Every computation, API (application programming interface) call and algorithmic function consumes energy, adding up across billions of devices, servers and users. According to the International Energy Agency, global data centres’ consumption is estimated to be between 2% and 3% of the world’s electricity. This could rise to over 1,000 terawatt-hours by 2030, equivalent to the entire electricity use of Japan. A portion of this demand stems from design choices and inefficient software. Code optimization is one of the accessible and impactful ways for practitioners to reduce energy use. This includes: Modularization: Breaking down code into smaller, reusable components enhances maintainability and minimizes redundant processes. Algorithm optimization: Choosing more computationally efficient algorithms can drastically reduce the number of operations needed to complete tasks. Resource-conscious development: Avoiding unnecessary background processing, reducing data transfers and minimizing user interface rendering cycles all contribute to lighter software. Questioning the “artificial intelligence (AI)-first” paradigm: As AI tools are increasingly embedded into digital products, practitioners must evaluate whether complex machine learning models are always necessary. Many AI-driven features are energy-intensive yet marginal in user impact. Prioritizing simpler, rule-based systems where appropriate can reduce compute demands and environmental costs. A 2022 study published in Electronics, an MDPI journal, stated that refactoring code optimizes software energy efficiency and significantly saves energy, depending on the application. Projects such as the Green Software Foundation are actively creating standards and toolkits to help developers embed sustainability into their coding practices. Clean energy for cloud While software runs on efficient code, it lives on digital infrastructure such as servers, networks and data centres that consume immense amounts of electricity. The shift to cloud computing, AI and high-performance workloads has further amplified these demands. According to an article from MIT Press Reader, data centres and other digital infrastructure account for over 2% of global carbon emissions, rivalling the aviation industry. To mitigate this impact, transitioning technology infrastructure to renewable energy is paramount and some leading cloud providers are making strides. However, the burden is not solely on hyperscalers. Technology practitioners, especially those in DevOps, infrastructure and platform roles, can push for greener deployments by: Selecting cloud regions powered by clean energy. Advocating for carbon-aware scheduling in distributed systems. Deploying workloads during periods of renewable energy availability. Monitoring and optimizing idle resource usage to avoid waste. By embedding sustainability into architectural choices, practitioners reduce emissions and build cost-effective, lightweight and energy-efficient systems. Open source and sustainability education While technical efficiency and clean energy are essential, the broader cultural shift toward responsible innovation depends on community engagement and knowledge sharing. Open-source software is uniquely positioned to be a catalyst for sustainable development. Its transparent nature allows for collaborative problem-solving and rapid dissemination of environmentally conscious practices. Notable examples include the Green Software Foundation, which provides open repositories and learning pathways for green development and Mozilla’s Sustainability Programme, which integrates environmental metrics into its open-source product reviews. Also, fostering sustainability education within the developer community is important for building long-term capacity. Curriculum initiatives such as the Software Carbon Intensity specification, piloted in universities and bootcamps, aim to equip future technologists with the tools to measure and reduce digital emissions. Technology companies also have a role to play. GitHub, for example, has introduced sustainability metrics in its Readme Project, showcasing OSS projects committed to green computing. Other ways technology practitioners can help drive responsible innovation through open-source initiatives and sustainability education include: Hosting sustainability-focused developer meetups or hackathons. Mentoring peers and students on eco-friendly coding and architecture. Monitoring and documenting the environmental impact of software decisions in engineering retrospectives. By cultivating a culture of transparency and shared responsibility, the technology community can accelerate the transition from isolated efforts to a widespread sustainability movement.

As the United Nations General Assembly continues discussions this week about regulating weapons that use artificial intelligence, some experts have raised concerns about the rapid advancement of autonomous military technology and its impact on modern warfare. Robert Bishop, vice chancellor and dean of engineering at Texas A &M University, addressed the assembly about the urgent need for regulation of these ""killer robots."" ""The technology has really gotten ahead of us,"" Bishop told ABC News. ""The application of the technology has moved faster than our policies and procedures."" At a recent UN summit, Secretary-General António Guterres warned that the growing technology risked deepening geopolitical divides and called for urgent ""global guardrails."" Robert Bishop urges ethical approach to AI warfare at UN meeting. ABC News Bishop told ABC News that AI technology could actually help reduce conflict if properly regulated. ""We can use this technology to reduce conflict through less-than-lethal action,"" he explained. ""We can also utilize the technology to help inform our policymakers so that they make better decisions."" When asked about the risks of leaving these weapons unregulated, Bishop said there were immediate concerns beyond science-fiction scenarios. ""The worst-case scenario in the near term is the gap that countries face,"" he told ABC News, explaining that this gap could lead to ""cybersecurity breaches, data breaches, and infrastructure breaches"" by bad actors. UN debates rules for AI weapons as experts warn of risks. Department of Defense Bishop explained the reluctance of some countries to embrace regulation in this matter. ""We're always cognizant of the fact that folks who may wish to do us harm are ahead of us,"" he said, citing concerns about hypersonic vehicles capable of carrying nuclear warheads as an example of why nations are cautious about limiting military AI development. However, Bishop suggests a different approach. He says Texas A &M University is creating a nonprofit organization to develop ethical approaches to AI use, working closely with industry, the Department of Defense and other academic institutions. He believes AI could be used to find less violent solutions to conflicts. ""If you know that a group of folks wants to do you harm, can you disrupt their ability to do that without kinetic weapons, without drones? The answer is yes,"" Bishop said. He suggests using AI to analyze data and present decision-makers with less-violent options for resolving conflicts. Last week, 96 countries met for the first-ever international meeting held at the United Nations focused specifically on autonomous weapons systems. The meeting, mandated by a General Assembly resolution from last December, brought together representatives from governments, international organizations, civil society, academia, and industry to address the growing concerns about AI-powered weapons. Guterres is pushing for clear rules on AI weapons by next year, with both the secretary-general and the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross calling for a legally binding agreement by 2026. The recent New York meeting expanded discussions beyond traditional military concerns to include human rights law, criminal law, and broader ethical considerations. ""We must prevent a world of AI 'haves' and 'have-nots,'"" Guterres said at AI Action Summit 2025. ""We must all work together so that artificial can bridge the gap between developed and developing countries – not widen it. It must accelerate sustainable development – not entrench inequalities.""","['Politics', 'Technology', 'World']","Killer Robots: Is the UN Too Late to Stop the AI Arms Race?

7,https://www.daytondailynews.com/local/kettering-health-technology-outage-continues-following-cyberattack/DNPYXRZLHRG6XJJQQ7QSH26RRE/,Kettering Health technology outage continues following cyberattack,"Powell has breast cancer, which has not yet spread to her lymph nodes. She’s currently scheduled for surgery on Friday, but she’s not sure yet if that will happen as planned since her doctors no longer have access to her medical records, including the testing she went through in preparation for this surgery. “I need this surgery because I need to get done before it spreads,” Powell said. Powell is not getting many answers, she said, adding that her care team likely doesn’t have the answers themselves as this technology outage continues. As Powell waits to find out whether or not she will have the surgery, she hopes that she is still able to get her procedure done at Kettering Health. “I absolutely love my team at Kettering (Health),” Powell said. “This is not Kettering’s fault. This is no one’s fault. This is just the world we live in.” Working on restoring access Hackers appear to be threatening to destroy data and publicly publish sensitive data on the dark web if hospital officials don’t reach out and negotiate within 72 hours, according to information shared with the Dayton Daily News by an anonymous source. “Teams across Kettering Health are working diligently around the clock to restore our systems in the aftermath of unauthorized access that caused a system-wide technology outage,” Kettering Health said in an updated statement Wednesday evening. “At this time, procedures are being evaluated on a case-by-case basis based upon collaborative decision-making between care teams, with safety as our highest priority,” Kettering Health said. If care teams have patients’ contact information, they will contact patients by phone about rescheduling procedures, the hospital system said. “While we recognize this process has not been seamless, and we ask for everyone’s patience while we continue to work through this issue,” Kettering Health said. Health care organizations at risk Kettering Health has not confirmed if the cyberattack is a ransomware incident, but this news outlet talked to an expert who speculates that this has the hallmarks of such an attack. “If we’re dealing with ransomware, one of the reasons that the health sector is seeing an increase in these types of attacks is, when you’re engaged in extortion, you want to coerce the other side to give you money, you want them to feel as much urgency as possible,” said Richard Harknett, director of the Center for Cyber Strategy and Policy at the University of Cincinnati. Ransomware gangs don’t want to risk getting identified if the interaction is too prolonged, he said, but there’s more at stake when it comes to people’s health care. “The implication is that people’s lives could be at stake if you could actually get to fundamental disruption of medical systems,” Harknett said. That puts a lot of pressure on the organization to pay up and pay quickly, he said. Cyber extortion Since the cyberattack at Kettering Health is known and causing an ongoing technology outage, it’s likely that any possible perpetrators are after financial gain from Kettering Health itself. “When we have systems lock up like this, it’s to coerce, to get something out of the organization,” Harknett said. “The primary goal for most of these actors is to get money (typically paid) in Bitcoin, a type of digital currency.” Ransomware attacks work by people infiltrating the victim’s system and locking the system with their own encryption so the victim’s computers are not able to access the information it’s supposed to be able to access, he said. “They have a key, a code, that they can give you that will unlock the malware that they use to lock up your system,” Harknett said. “That’s what happens in the first level of extortion. They say, ‘Here you are, we’ve locked up your system, pay us this, or you don’t get your system back.” This can be expensive for the organization to deal with, and the malware can be nearly impossible for the victim to get around on their own, he said. ‘Not your basement hooded hackers’ Online speculation has questioned whether or not the perpetrator would have any reason not to go ahead and sell stolen data on the dark web even after getting its ransom payment from the victim. The gangs that perpetrate these crimes are sophisticated organizations, Harknett said, and they have an incentive to be seen as trustworthy thieves. “These are not your basement hooded hackers,” Harknett said. These organizations, in most cases, have technical teams that do the exploiting, a separate negotiating team to put pressure on the victim and then a financial team who will collect the ransom, Harknett said. “They’re very public about it. They have reputations that they want to maintain as being the biggest and the baddest,” Harknett said. If an organization like this were to take the ransom and then sell the data anyway, there’s less of a reason for their future victims to pay the ransom. “They have data leak sites attributing themselves to attacks. I know, as of last night, no one had posted to known data leak sites responsibility for this. They usually wait until they conclude the attack,” Harknett said. The idea is that they can show future victims that they will follow through on what they said they would do as proof that they will de-encrypt the victim’s computer system. “You can trust us to be honorable thieves is the kind of reputation building that they engage in,” Harknett said. Concerns over identity theft There’s not much for the public to do at this point, but people who are concerned about their information getting stolen can monitor their credit cards if they are worried about identity theft. Be wary of very small, unknown purchases that are like $2 or $3 type purchases. Those can be tests to see whether the credit card will be accepted before the perpetrator tries for a larger purchase. “We understand our patients’ concerns for their privacy and information security. We have no evidence that personal cell phone apps, like MyChart, or the information in them have been compromised,” Kettering Health said. Additionally, Kettering Health will never reach out to staff or patients via social media, it said. Kettering Health will also be sharing updates about this cyberattack at ketteringhealth.org/system-wide-technology-outage. Region adapting to challenges Premier Health declined to comment on the impact of Kettering Health’s technology outage might be having on its operations or if patients are being referred to their hospitals. Mercy Health saw a slight increase in patient volumes in its emergency department and a few surgical cases, but its operations are otherwise unaffected, the organization said. Member hospitals of the Greater Dayton Area Hospital Association are continuing to work together to increase staffing and capacity at non-impacted acute care facilities to ensure the region’s health care system can meet the community’s needs, the association said Wednesday evening. Local jurisdictions’ emergency medical services are also receiving updates pertaining to patient transport. “GDAHA is working closely with Kettering Health and local jurisdictions to provide timely updates through the statewide EMS platform and ensure that EMS crews have access to the most up-to-date, accurate information for patient transport decisions,” the association said.","['Health', 'Technology', 'Crime']","**Cyberattack Delays Cancer Surgery: Patient's Life on the Line**
","A cyberattack on Kettering Health has caused a system-wide technology outage, preventing a cancer patient, Powell, from receiving scheduled surgery due to inaccessible medical records.  The attack, possibly ransomware, is threatening data destruction and public release unless demands are met, forcing Kettering Health to evaluate procedures on a case-by-case basis while other area hospitals adjust to increased patient volume.  Experts warn of the sophisticated nature of these attacks and the pressure on healthcare systems to pay ransoms quickly. ","Key Insights and Takeaways from the Kettering Health Cyberattack Article:

* **Patient Impact:** A significant technology outage at Kettering Health, potentially caused by a ransomware attack, is severely impacting patient care.  A cancer patient's surgery is delayed due to inaccessible medical records, highlighting the immediate and serious consequences for individuals.  Other procedures are being evaluated on a case-by-case basis, causing delays and uncertainty.

* **Cyberattack Details:**  The attack appears to be a ransomware attack, where hackers demand payment in exchange for restoring access to data.  The hackers are threatening to release sensitive patient data on the dark web if their demands aren't met within 72 hours.  The attackers are sophisticated, organized, and operate like a business, aiming to maintain a reputation for trustworthiness (even amongst criminals) to encourage future victims to pay ransoms.

* **System-Wide Disruption:** The outage is system-wide, affecting access to medical records and causing delays and cancellations of procedures.  Kettering Health is working to restore systems, but the timeline remains uncertain.  Other hospital systems in the region are experiencing increased patient volume as a result.

* **Financial Motivation:** The primary goal of the perpetrators is financial gain.  Ransomware attacks like this leverage the urgency of the situation (especially in healthcare) to pressure organizations into paying quickly.

* **Data Security Concerns:** While Kettering Health assures patients that MyChart data hasn't been compromised, the potential for data breaches and identity theft remains a significant concern.  Patients are advised to monitor their credit reports for suspicious activity.

* **Regional Collaboration:**  Hospitals in the Dayton area are collaborating to manage the increased patient load and ensure continued care for the community during the crisis.


In short, the article highlights the devastating impact of ransomware attacks on healthcare systems, not only on the organization's finances and operations but, more critically, on patients' lives and well-being. The sophistication of the attackers and the potential for widespread data breaches underscore the growing threat of cybercrime in the healthcare sector.

9,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/05/21/turtles-telemetry-wildlife-tracking/,Opinion | Technology broke our connection to nature. Here is a way back.,"I am playing the world’s slowest video game. Sitting in front of a monitor with a technician from the Smithsonian, I am watching the progress of Turtle 4004, known as Roxy. She’s an older box turtle, and a GPS tag on her shell records hourly updates of her location. But box turtles, on average, move only about 2 centimeters per hour — which makes for some obvious tedium for those tracking her progress. The tech reads out updates on Roxy’s peregrinations to me. 7:18 a.m.: She’s on the edge of a field on the property in Castleton, Virginia. 8:18 a.m.: She’s in the same place. 9:18 a.m.: She still hasn’t moved. And then, the 10:18 GPS reading produces excitement. “It looks like she shoots down here like 15 meters or so,” the tech, Mark Ketner says, showing me the dot on the screen.. But then the 11:18 reading shows Roxy is right back where she was earlier in the morning. Ketner concludes that the 10 a.m. reading was an error. Roxy hasn’t budged. Nor does she move for the rest of the day. Nor the entire next day, nor the next two. Ketner concludes that she must be lounging, day after day and night after night, in a particularly comfy patch of leaf litter or underneath a favorite shrub — happily munching slugs without a care in the world. Finally, on the fifth and sixth days, the cluster of dots shows unmistakably that Roxy is on the move — about 15 meters south. Five days later, Roxy moves again — this time, she hooks a right turn and crawls about 15 meters into the woods. After two weeks and dozens of data points, Roxy has completed her tortuous migration from field to forest. Follow Dana Milbank Follow Watching these research subjects move at the speed of a tortoise, I wonder whether the scientists might have found it more rewarding to study the hare. Advertisement And yet, in just two years of tracking turtles by GPS, they have advanced our understanding of these animals by leaps and bounds. The sort of work being done on Roxy is already producing new strategies to rescue her compatriots from their long, slow decline. In a broader sense, these technologies have the potential to transform the field of ecology for creatures large and small — and, not least, to reestablish humans’ connection with nature. Last year, researchers from the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute in Front Royal, Virginia, and the Clifton Institute in Warrenton gathered 16,000 data points showing the movement of 11 turtles. This year, they will monitor 50 turtles and collect far more data — not just GPS but temperature readings and measurements of the reptiles’ actual ground speed — that will show precisely when and why turtles move. Already, they have learned that box turtles, historically thought of as a forest species, spend far more time in fields than was previously understood. Over the next year or two, scientists will use this information to broadcast public warnings about when box turtles are active in fields and across roads, and to forecast when conditions will have the right combination of temperature, cloud cover, humidity and precipitation for turtles to be on the move. These forecasts, like daily fire-danger ratings, will let people know to avoid mowing on these days or to be on the lookout for turtles crossing roads. Turtles are “arguably the most threatened animals with a backbone out there,” says Tom Akre, program director for the Smithsonian’s Turtle Conservation Ecology Lab. Some 60 percent of turtle species are threatened or endangered, and even relatively common ones such as the box turtle are in trouble because of habitat loss, climate change, disease and poaching. “Turtles do everything slowly — they walk slowly, they feed slowly, they move across the landscape slowly, they mature slowly, they reproduce slowly — and that makes them incredibly vulnerable in the modern world.” But the good news is the study of their movements suggests even a small change in human behavior, such as avoiding mowing on high turtle-movement days, could make a huge difference in the survival of these animals. The same is true for other creatures great and small. Technological breakthroughs in the field of telemetry — tracking animals’ movements through GPS, radio frequency and acoustics — have exploded in recent years, with the miniaturization of GPS technology and the proliferation of radio monitoring towers. Movement ecologists use these techniques to track the migration patterns of sea birds and grassland birds; to study the underwater migrations of sharks, striped bass and herring; and to see the movements of giraffes, wildebeest, dama gazelles and scimitar-horned oryx in Africa. Barn owls, kestrels, warblers and even dragonflies can now be tracked. It has dramatically reshaped understandings of how these critters move, forage and reproduce. Over the past couple of months, I’ve been following scientists around as they do this type of work in Virginia. I’ve waded waist-deep in the Rappahannock River in search of river herring, which can now be tracked on their migratory journey of more than 1,000 miles from tiny inland creeks of the Mid-Atlantic to the coast of Maine and Canada. I’ve observed scientists as they went to capture American kestrels — small falcons that have been in decline — in nesting boxes to do maintenance on the solar-powered GPS tags they carry as “backpacks” on their trips to Georgia and Florida. And I’ve tromped through field and forest in pursuit of highly charismatic box turtles with names such as Stanley, Snoop and Buttercup, each carrying GPS and radio tags on their backs. In general, technology detaches us from nature, not to mention from each other. But in limited ways, technology can also put people — even rubes like me with no scientific expertise — in touch with nature in ways we never before have been. On my phone, Cornell’s Merlin app identifies all the birds I’m hearing, and the Haikubox installed on my porch keeps a list of birds who call when I’m not at home. Another app, iNaturalist, and its sister app, Seek, can identify virtually any plant or insect using my phone’s camera. Trail cameras record high-resolution video of bears, bobcats and coyotes on my farm. WiFi cameras in my bird boxes send me images of what’s happening inside. The burgeoning field of telemetry, likewise, lets people get up close and personal with animals, letting us understand their movements and leaving us with practical conservation strategies that laypeople can follow. For example, scientists have long known that cutting hay in fields decimates the population of grassland birds such as meadowlarks and bobolinks, whose nests get mowed down during haying. But farmers weren’t about to surrender their livelihood and stop making hay. So Smithsonian researchers, using telemetry, found that, by the end of June, 80 percent of fledglings were old enough to fly out of the field and escape oncoming tractors. And so they made a practical suggestion to farmers: If possible, try to delay your first cut until July 1. This is part of a wholesale rethinking of conservation biology that has occurred over decades, as ecologists gradually abandoned the idea of “fortress conservation,” or protecting wild places from the presence of humans. Instead, ecology has shifted toward an acknowledgment that people have irreversibly changed every inch of the globe, mostly for the worse. We are well into a biodiversity crisis that is driving rare species into extinction and abundant species into decline. The goal now is less preservation than finding ways to optimize wildlife diversity and abundance on lands that are already compromised by humans. And to figure out which conservation strategies will produce the biggest bang for the buck, you need data to show what the animals actually need. “The more practical approach to conservation says, look, we’re not going to preserve thousands and thousands of acres of native meadow habitat, because these lands are being used,” explains Joe Kolowski, another Smithsonian wildlife ecologist who tracks kestrels. “So to say what the options are for these lands, you really have to drill down into the details.” The new data on animal movements provides those details. “It’s just orders of magnitude more information,” Kolowski says. “We’re just swimming in data right now.” Actually, I’m wading in the Rappahannock River right now, along with Henry Legett, a specialist in river herring with the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center in Edgewater, Maryland. Generations ago, there were so many alewife and blueback herring and so many American and hickory shad in this river that it was said you could walk across the river on their backs. They nourished the colonists, and Virginians held salting festivals into the 20th century, until a combination of dams and overfishing all but wiped out the fish. In recent years, the dams have been removed and a fishing ban imposed — yet the herring population hasn’t recovered, as it was predicted to. Environmental DNA samples show that they are here, even far inland where we are, on the border of Fauquier and Rappahannock counties, but their numbers are paltry. Leggett leads me through deep mud and over slippery stones into a pool where he hopes to find some river herring — nothing. He throws a few stones into a deeper pool, thinking some will emerge — but they don’t. He strings a gill net across the whole river and appears to find one — “Oh! Ooh!” he says — but it’s just a few hickory shad. “In a watershed like this, it’s like trying to resurrect a ghost,” he says. Advertisement Some of the problem is obviously climate change (the fish tend to leave the rivers for the bay when temperatures are above 70 degrees, and on our visit it’s 77) and pollution (the foamy scum on the river from agricultural runoff where we are). But telemetry discovered that the situation is more complex. Legett and his colleagues have been tagging the foot-long herring with tiny, ultrasonic acoustic tags, which transmit their location to underwater receivers, and they’ve found that the herring migrate much further up the North American coast than scientists had previously known. They also found out that only about 15 percent of herring survive the round-trip migration. (Although one savvy fish has made the journey seven times). Two apparent reasons: The fish are being caught as “bycatch” by Maine and Canadian fisheries looking for mackerel and Atlantic herring, and they are being devoured by invasive blue catfish where the river meets the Chesapeake Bay. Legett and his colleagues are developing ways to calculate how many of the fish are succumbing to predators and how many are being caught in New England waters — which in turn should offer potential solutions. But it’s already clear that the herring are missing from Virginia’s rivers at least in part because they’re being fished in the Gulf of Maine. While Legett wades through the tributaries of Virginia, Alan Williams steers his pickup truck through its backroads, visiting one kestrel box after another, banding the babies and tending to the solar backpacks of their parents. The GPS backpacks, at $1,000 apiece and 3½ grams, are high-tech. Williams’s techniques are not. He blocks the entrance to the bird house with an empty yogurt cup on an extension poll, captures the adult bird in a net and then puts it in a Pringles can for safekeeping while the backpack is serviced. Some 70 birds have so far been outfitted with these backpacks. Once the electronics are on the bird, the data can be downloaded wirelessly with a receiver — also in Williams’s truck — if he is within 300 meters of the animal. One afternoon, I watch Williams remove a malfunctioning backpack from Abby, a bird in Washington, Virginia.; she endures the procedure with patience, putting up no struggle as she goes in and out of the Pringles can. But on another day in Woodville, Virginia, a kestrel named Dee thwarts Williams and his crew for the better part of two hours: When one kestrel hunter closes in on her box, Dee flies out and hovers over her pursuers, waiting for them to leave so she can return to her five eggs. She desperately needs a haircut because her feathers are partially covering her solar panel — but it will have to wait for another day. If telemetry found the river herring’s troubles to be 1,000 miles away, it found the kestrel’s troubles to be closer to home. While other birds thrive in native meadows where plants can be six feet tall, the scientists were surprised to find that kestrels avoid those areas, preferring pastures for their hunting. If there isn’t a pasture or other low vegetation in the area, the kestrels will pick up and leave. “We think it’s simply too tall for them to hunt in these meadows,” Kolowski says. Wildlife ecologists have encouraged the planting of native meadows, but this finding suggests the kestrel prefers a matrix of habitats. It takes us only about 10 minutes to find turtle 4008, Tyrion, on the property of Dick and Nancy Raines, who are sponsors of the turtle project. Maxwell Earle, from the turtle lab, takes an old-fashioned Yagi antenna from his truck, aims it into the woods, and listens for a ping from the turtle’s tag. The pinging gets louder as we walk, until finally we stop and find Tyrion, lounging under a fern. He’s a handsome fellow, about 20 years old, with red eyes and an elaborate black-and-gold pattern on his shell. He kicks his legs in mild protest as Earle shows off the $600 worth of technology on his back. Tyrion had been eating — he has remnants of a slug on his face, a condition Earle calls “slug mug” — and he hurries away at a rapid clip (for a turtle) when we put him back down. From there, Earle dials in a different frequency and it takes just two minutes to find Turtle 4041, Misty, a 50ish female, who is lounging at the edge of a field. (Box turtles have an average lifespan of 25 to 35 years but can live to more than 100, with older females producing larger clutches and healthier offspring.) “Hello, mama!” Earle says, picking up Misty, who is calm. She is round with more muted coloring, and her carapace is polished smooth from half a century of wear. “Isn’t that amazing?” Dick Raines says of the venerable creature. “That’s why they’re so precious.” And this is the real purpose of the turtle project: not just to learn about them but also to make landowners feel proud to have these magnificent animals in their fields and forests — and open to new ways of managing their land to keep the turtles alive. The Smithsonian, Clifton and other organizations are promoting a “Raise the Blade” campaign to persuade farmers to cut fields no shorter than eight inches. Next will come the fire-alert announcements of when turtles are on the move. Advertisement For the turtles, it can’t come soon enough — even for those in the Smithsonian study. One participant, Turtle 4022, wandered onto a neighbor’s field last year and was crushed by a tractor. “This is not simply a scientific project,” says Akre, the turtle program director. The new telemetry technologies, he explains, “allow us to both show people the animals in a way we couldn’t otherwise and also to tell a very real story.” By watching the turtles’ GPS movements, “people can actually see the animal. They can see it behaving, and they can see what it has done and that connects them to the life of the animal, more so than just observing it in the moment. The more you know about any organism, the more you can empathize with it or understand it.”","['Science', 'Environment', 'Technology']","The World's Slowest Video Game: A Turtle's Journey Reveals a Race Against Extinction

This marks the fourth consecutive year Airbnb has implemented these defenses to block certain bookings over these holidays with the aim of reducing the risk of disruptive parties, which are banned on our platform. Although incidents of disruptive parties on Airbnb are rare, we are committed to working to reduce the risk and helping hosts promote positive experiences in their homes and local neighborhoods. Our anti-party technology is designed to help identify and prevent certain attempts to book one-to-two-night stays in entire home listings that could be higher risk for a disruptive party. The system looks at a range of factors – including the type of listing being booked, the duration of the stay, the distance to the listing from the guest’s primary location and whether the booking is last minute – to determine whether a booking should be blocked. Guests who are prevented from booking an entire home will instead have the option to book alternative accommodations on Airbnb. Last year, these defenses saw approximately 51,000 people across the United States deterred from booking an entire home listing on the platform across both summer holiday weekends. This included approximately 7750 people in Texas, 7400 people in Florida, and 7030 people in California.

Reese has started construction on East 90 Business Park, right across the street from the current campus west of Lubbock. Reese Technology Center CEO Murvat Musa says the new space will make room for an often-overlooked business sector, mid-sized manufacturing companies. “I think we focused in this country nationally on very large corporations and very small businesses, but we’re forgetting that there’s another section in there that we need to service,” she said. Musa says those mid-sized companies are looking for a place to land, but finding one in Lubbock has been difficult lately. “That type of space in Lubbock is leased. I don’t think there’s any capacity and we get tons of calls for that type of space. And so, there’s a demand for it, and that demand’s been ongoing for numerous years,” she said. A political subdivision of the state, the goal out at Reese is to create jobs and bring private investment to the region. Musa says that’s what it’s been doing for 28 years, since the Air Force base closed. To expand that mission, it’s started construction on East 90 Business Park, right across Research Boulevard. Musa hopes years from now, the 90 acres will be full of strong businesses. “The project we’re doing right now is only going to cover about a third of the property, but a third of the property is a lot of acres. That’s probably over 30 acres. And we can locate lots of customers there,” Musa said. Previously, the land was used for housing for Reese Air Force Base, so Musa says it took some time to get rid of the infrastructure from the neighborhood. “There were...I think about 400 houses that were located there, and they were taken out many years ago and it’s taken us quite a long time to figure out how to clean up the remainder of the infrastructure,” she said. The Economic Development Administration provided a $2 million grant to go alongside Reese’s $1.5 million to get the project going. Musa says that money will be poured back into the Lubbock economy through the businesses that will move to the park. “They bring jobs and that’s the number one thing that we’re charged to do. So, they’re going to bring jobs and those people are going to live in Lubbock and are going to spend their money in Lubbock and they’re going to buy houses in Lubbock. So, that just circulates more money into the economy,” Musa said. She expects construction for roads and infrastructure for the first portion of the park should be completed by the end of this fall.

18,https://ukstories.microsoft.com/features/challenging-stigma-mental-health-and-the-transformative-power-of-technology/,Challenging stigma: Mental health and the transformative power of technology,"Each May, Microsoft marks Mental Health Awareness Month, and this year’s theme is ‘Be Kind to your Mind’. We talk to three courageous Microsoft colleagues about their experiences with anxiety and how they deal with it, through openness, allyship and helpful technology. Click here to load media According to mental health charity Mind UK, 1-in-4 people will experience a mental health challenge of some kind each year in the UK, yet only a third will get any help. More than half say this is because of the stigma associated with admitting to poor mental health. This feature attempts to challenge that stigma. Clare Brown: From Burnout to Empowerment Industrial Sector Lead, Clare Brown, has faced battles with anxiety and ADHD. Her journey began with what she thought was high-functioning anxiety, but it wasn’t until her daughters were diagnosed with ADHD that she realised she too had the condition. This revelation led her to seek therapy and coaching, which she credits with saving her life. Clare’s turning point came during a period of high stress while working in a difficult environment before she joined Microsoft. “I was operating in a really toxic culture, working 20-hour days, and I was miserable,” she recalls. A family intervention made her realise she needed to make a change. “I thought I’d reached the pinnacle of my career, but I just wasn’t happy,” she says. At this point, Clare left her high-powered role and took a step back to focus on her values and purpose. Setting boundaries Through therapy, coaching, and practices like journaling and ‘box breathing’, Clare found her way back to herself. “I practised and practised and started doing things that I love,” she says. She also emphasises the importance of setting boundaries and having a routine to manage anxiety. “I have a very set end-of-work routine where I box breathe, journal, and visualise the best version of myself,” she explains. Clare Brown says playing a game on her mobile phone can be calming When feeling overwhelmed, Clare cites technology such as mobile gaming as a source of comfort in managing her anxiety. “The way I cope with overwhelm is to go on my phone and play a game. It focuses my mind and calms me down, but in a previous role I was told off for not focusing,” she says. Attitudes are different at Microsoft, she says. In a poignant moment of allyship, her colleague, Steve Chawner, noticed her playing games on her phone during a stressful event. “Steve leaned over and asked, ‘Is that helping you feel better?’ It was the kindest, most empathetic comment that put me at ease,” she says. Flora Rowe: Thriving with Anxiety Flora, a Client Solutions Manager in Microsoft Advertising, has lived with anxiety for most of her life. Her journey began in her early teen years, and she describes it as a series of functioning and non-functioning periods. “In my early teen years, I was definitely in the non-functioning part where socialising and doing normal things was really challenging,” she shares. As Flora grew older, she learned coping mechanisms and received support that helped her manage anxiety better, believing that anxiety has shaped her into a more empathetic and understanding person. “Anxiety has made me consider how other people feel and think about how we can be more inclusive,” she explains. “Sometimes just having a day with notifications off can be incredibly helpful“ Flora Rowe “Without doubt, therapy has been the most useful thing for managing anxiety,” but she also finds mindfulness practices and regularity helpful, she says. “Making sure I have a good routine and healthy outlets for my anxiety, like running or going to a gallery, is really important.” Technology has also played a crucial supporting role in Flora’s journey. She uses Headspace (an app available for free to Microsoft employees) every day and appreciates the flexibility within Teams to manage notifications. “Sometimes just having a day with notifications off can be incredibly helpful,” she says. And while “social media can be anxiety-inducing,” she says, “it has also been so helpful finding communities and people to share tips with.” Faith la Grange: Creating Safe Spaces Faith La Grange, the Area Consulting Lead for the UK at Microsoft, has a profound understanding of mental health, having trained as a counsellor and psychotherapist. Her journey began with a desire to support others, both in her personal life and at work. “It gave me a really clear view and understanding of what people are going through when they’re struggling with mental health issues,” she says. Faith emphasises the importance of creating safe spaces where individuals can express their vulnerabilities without fear of judgment. “For me, it all starts with being a safe space for somebody to come and show their vulnerability and talk about the things that are really concerning them,” she explains. This approach makes her a trusted confidant and ally, both at work and in her personal life, she feels. ‘To Do’ list anxiety Faith also highlights the role of technology in managing anxiety, particularly as a reminder tool. “Breathing is amazing. To be able to just sit and do a box-breathing exercise to centre yourself is brilliant,” she says. “I wear a watch that reminds me to do them. It can be helpful when, in the moment, you’re too hyped up to be able to really think about how you how you calm yourself down.” “Using Copilot to prepare and prioritise can help people manage some of the overwhelming anxiety they feel“ Faith la Grange Additionally, Faith mentions how Microsoft’s Copilot feature has transformative power in reducing anxiety by helping people prepare for meetings and manage overwhelming tasks. “I remember during a manager session we had someone discuss using Copilot to prepare, whether it’s for an anxiety-inducing meeting or prioritising your inbox when returning from holiday” she recalls. “It can feel like the to-do list is insurmountable, but using Copilot to prepare and prioritise can help people manage some of the overwhelming anxiety they feel.” Allyship and technology Ellie Jeffries, Nuffield Health’s Wellbeing Manager who has spearheaded mental health awareness campaigns for Microsoft, says: “The stories of Faith, Clare, and Flora serve to remind us of the importance of allyship and creating safe spaces. “By being open about their mental health journeys and how they support others, and have been supported themselves, they foster an environment where individuals feel empowered to seek help and be their authentic selves. “Their resilience, supported by the power of technology, reminds us that we are not alone in our mental health journeys. Together, we can create a more supportive and inclusive world.”","['Health', 'Technology', 'Opinion']","**Microsoft Employees Reveal:  How Tech Fights Anxiety & What You Can Learn**

19,https://blogs.icrc.org/law-and-policy/2025/05/22/the-shifting-battlefield-technology-tactics-and-the-risk-of-blurring-lines-of-warfare/,"The shifting battlefield: technology, tactics, and the risk of blurring lines of warfare","The accelerating integration of emerging technologies into armed conflict is transforming not only the tools of war, but its tactics, geography, participants and impact. Technological developments – from commercial drones to artificial intelligence, electronic warfare to the military use of civilian infrastructure – risk undermining boundaries between military and civilian domains. These changes challenge long-held assumptions about the character and conduct of warfare, how wars are fought in practice, while raising legal and humanitarian concerns for the protection of civilians and the preservation of the principle of distinction. In this post, Ruben Stewart, ICRC Adviser on New Technologies of Warfare, explores the drivers and implications of this transformation. He focuses on how evolving technologies and trends are influencing the conduct of hostilities and impacting the protection of civilians. He underscores the urgent need to uphold legal norms amid these shifts, particularly the principle of distinction, ensuring that complexity does not become a pretext for non-compliance. At the heart of his analysis is a call to reckon with the profound humanitarian consequences these changes impose on those caught in conflict. The character of armed conflict is changing. Innovations once confined to the science fiction genre or laboratories are deployed on today’s battlefields. At the same time, new methods of warfare are emerging that risk blurring long-standing lines: between military and civilian, physical and digital, and activities that are part of an armed conflict and those that aren’t. This transformation is not merely technological; it is conceptual, doctrinal, and strategic. Conflict today is shaped by three overarching and interconnected trends: the pursuit of reduced risk driven by force protection considerations, the drive to increase lethality, and the growing integration of civilians and civilian objects into military activities. Each poses distinctive challenges to the protection of civilian populations, the application of international humanitarian law (IHL), and risks shaking some of the very assumptions that underlie the conduct of war. The rise of uncrewed and autonomous systems Arguably the most visible and widely adopted military innovation of the last decade has been the proliferation of uncrewed systems: drones in the air, vehicles on the ground, and vessels at sea. Once accessible only to a handful of technologically advanced states, they are now a near-ubiquitous feature of contemporary warfare, including by non-state armed groups (NSAG). Two categories dominate this landscape. First are commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) systems repurposed for military use that are affordable, adaptable, and often disposable. Originally designed and built for civilian use they are now used for Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), Command and Control and Communications (C3) and, increasingly, to undertake attacks. Second are purpose-built uncrewed systems designed specifically for military operations. These include long-range strike drones, autonomous loitering munitions, and ground-based platforms for combat support, logistics, and even medical evacuation. Production figures from ongoing conflicts demonstrate the scale of this transformation. Where once only a few states had access to a limited number of systems, the majority of state militaries now have access to fleets of systems, some numbering in the millions. These numbers indicate not just tactical adaptation but a fundamental shift in how military force is generated and projected. Uncrewed maritime and ground vehicles are also rapidly advancing. Naval drones have been used in offensive operations against ships, coastal targets, helicopters and fixed wing aircraft. Ground platforms are being trialled and deployed for everything from mine-laying to combat support. A recent joint operation conducted entirely by uncrewed systems, albeit at limited scale, offers a glimpse of what fully automated conflict might one day entail. Seeing everything, everywhere, all the time: persistent sensors and the information environment Another defining feature of today’s battlefield is the explosion in data collection and sensor integration. Modern militaries and non-state actors rely on a vast array of inputs such as thermal imaging and night vision devices, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), radar, acoustic sensors, metadata, and satellite feeds to create a common operational picture (COP). But this COP is not generated by military assets alone. Civilian devices, especially mobile phones, serve as both intelligence gathering and command, control and communication systems. Phone users can knowingly collect and transmit battlefield intelligence but in other instances, their devices are used without their knowledge to locate, track, and categorize them for potential targeting. Vast amounts of personal data, such as call logs, app metadata, and geolocations can be harvested from civilian sources, processed by AI-enabled systems, and repurposed for targeting, profiling, or influence operations. To facilitate the transfer and processing of this information, there has also been a merging of civilian and military information infrastructure and tools. Commercial satellites, data centres, civilian software and telecommunications networks are now routinely used to translate, categorize and store communications intercepted by the military, transmit battlefield data, and facilitate command and control. The legal implications are stark. When civilian digital infrastructure becomes instrumental to military operations, it may also become a military objective. In addition, individuals risk being targeted not for what they do, but for what their devices appear to reveal about them. The invisible battlefield: electronic warfare and communication interference As reliance on digital communication has grown, so too has the vulnerability of these systems. Electronic Warfare (EW), including jamming, spoofing, and signal interception has become a central component of contemporary conflict. In some engagements, EW has reduced the accuracy of precision-guided munitions from a margin of error of under 20 metres to more than a kilometre. Crewed and uncrewed aerial systems have been grounded, forced to abort their flights, or lost due to jamming. Encrypted radios have been captured or rendered useless, forcing operators to revert to analogue tools such as paper maps and using commercial mobile phones. Commercially available jammers are now in use by non-state actors to disrupt communication and navigation. In addition to their tactical effects, electronic emissions themselves create risks: even brief emissions can reveal a unit’s location for targeting. In response, some militaries are adopting more resilient systems, such as fibre-optic communication lines for drones. Others are experimenting with autonomous weapons that do not require an active control link at all, effectively removing humans from a decision-making role. Artificial intelligence and the speed of war Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly becoming a tool in how wars are fought. AI is being used to identify targets, analyze and manage sensor data, translate communications, and plan and coordinate uncrewed operations. In conflict, AI-enabled systems can compress the “kill chain” (the sequence from detection to strike) from minutes to seconds. In some applications, AI has reportedly been used to recommend targets and even facilitate strikes with apparently limited human review. Current AI systems are generally designed to support, rather than replace, human decision-making. But this support can become substitution when decisions are made at such speed that human oversight is functionally impossible – a condition sometimes described as “AI singularity”. Beyond targeting, AI is being integrated into logistics, surveillance, and strategic planning. Militaries are pursuing “human–machine teaming” concepts, pairing AI powered platforms with crewed systems to enhance operational efficiency. Aerial “loyal wingman” systems – uncrewed aircraft that fly alongside piloted jets – are already operational in some contexts. As AI systems mature, their influence will likely extend across all levels of warfare. At the same time, questions remain about legal accountability, error rates, and the ability to meaningfully apply IHL to systems that adapt in ways not even their designers may fully understand. The increasing use of long-range strike and hypersonic weapons Another notable trend is the expanded use of long-range and high-velocity weapons, including extended range drones, ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and increasingly, hypersonic glide vehicles. These systems allow actors to strike targets over 1,000 kilometres away – far from the front lines and often deep within the opponent’s territory. These long-range capabilities have been generated by developing new systems and in other cases by retrofitting existing munitions with enhancements that extend their range and converting existing systems such as air-defence missiles to be used in a ground-attack role. Hypersonic weapons – defined as those travelling at more than five times the speed of sound – are particularly concerning due to their manoeuvrability and speed, which render many existing missile defences ineffective. Trials and deployments are increasing, with some of the first operational uses reported in 2024. The implications for civilian safety are clear: as the range and speed of weapons increase, so does the vulnerability of critical infrastructure and population centres far from frontlines, and often without the mitigation of timely warnings or effective interception by air defence systems. The expanding domain of warfare Modern warfare is no longer confined to land, sea, and air – there is increasing military activity in the cyber and space domains, as well as in the information environment. Cyber operations targeting public infrastructure, communications networks, and transportation systems have become more frequent. Activities below the threshold of armed conflict such as GPS interference affecting civilian aviation, cyber sabotage, and disinformation campaigns are now routine features of interstate competition. In space, the sheer number of satellites launched in recent years, often numbering in the hundreds in a single year, illustrate the growing centrality of space for ISR and C3. The jamming, spoofing, or even physical interference of both military and commercial satellites and concerns about the use of nuclear-generated electromagnetic pulses (EMP) to disable low Earth orbit satellites underscore the fragility of this domain. From defence to “total defence” In response to the growing scale and complexity of threats, several states have adopted “total defence” strategies, i.e. whole-of-society approaches that integrate military, civilian, economic, and technological resources into national security planning. These strategies often include guidance for civilians on how to prepare for emergencies, maintain essential services, and, in some cases, contribute to national defence efforts. Additionally, national defence frameworks include considerations of how tech companies and civilian critical infrastructure such as telecommunications, ICT services, and satellite networks may be used to support military defence efforts. While civilian involvement may enhance states’ resilience, involving civilians more directly in support roles – such as information gathering, logistics, or civil resistance – raises serious humanitarian concerns. For instance, the closer civilians and civilian ICT infrastructure are drawn into military activities, the greater the risk of exposure to harm and the more challenging respect for the principle of distinction under international humanitarian law. States implementing total defence models should consider how to balance preparedness with protection, ensuring that civilians remain safeguarded from the effects of hostilities and are not placed at unnecessary risk through their involvement in military operations. Humanitarian consequences and the need for reflection Across all these developments, one worrying trend is constant: the increasing blurring of civilian and military domains. Whether through the military use of COTS technologies, the use of civilian infrastructure for military purposes, or the mobilization of civilians themselves, the line between combatant and non-combatant risks becoming ever more difficult to draw. This is particularly relevant where the military use of civilians or civilian objects raises questions about the compatibility of such use with the obligation to protect them from the effects of hostilities under IHL. If the line between civilians and the military becomes blurred, the principle of distinction, the obligation to differentiate between military objectives and civilian persons and objects, becomes harder to implement. So too are rules relating to proportionality, precautions in attack, and the protection of civilian infrastructure. Moreover, as warfare becomes faster, more automated, and more data-driven, the scope for meaningful human judgement narrows. Decisions with life-or-death consequences may be made at machine speed and based on inputs and programming that are invisible to human operators. Conclusion: towards a more complex battlespace The battlespace of the future will be shaped by three converging trends: the reduction of risk through uncrewed and long-range systems and automation of dangerous tasks; the pursuit of greater lethality through networks of sensors, faster decision making, and multi-domain operations; and we risk seeing a growing military integration of civilians and civilian objects, from infrastructure and COTS tools, through to total defence strategies. These innovations and their employment must be matched by greater consideration of the consequences and adoption of safeguards to reduce the risk of civilian harm. As the character of conflict evolves, armed actors must constantly refer back to legal, ethical, and humanitarian frameworks guiding their application. Technology can reshape how wars are fought, but their causes and whom they affect remain relatively constant. As the lines blur and warfare accelerates, it becomes ever more urgent to hold firm to the principles and rules that distinguish armed conflict from indiscriminate violence, namely international humanitarian law. These norms are not optional – they are essential to preserving our shared humanity. Far from being a burden, those norms offer a framework to navigate complexity, impose clarity amid confusion, and help ensure that technological innovation does not come at the expense of civilian lives.

","The integration of emerging technologies like AI, drones, and electronic warfare is fundamentally changing the nature of armed conflict, blurring the lines between military and civilian spheres.  This transformation raises serious legal and humanitarian concerns, particularly regarding the protection of civilians and the upholding of international humanitarian law, especially the principle of distinction.  The author urges a focus on the humanitarian consequences of these technological advancements and a commitment to maintaining legal norms in this increasingly complex battlespace. ","The article highlights the profound transformation of warfare driven by the rapid integration of emerging technologies.  Key insights and takeaways include:

**1. Blurring of Lines:**  The most significant takeaway is the increasing blurring of lines between military and civilian spheres. This manifests in several ways:

* **Military use of civilian technologies:** Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) technologies, originally designed for civilian use, are now widely used for military purposes (e.g., drones, software, communication networks).
* **Integration of civilian infrastructure:** Civilian infrastructure (telecommunications, satellites, data centers) is increasingly critical for military operations, making it a potential military objective.
* **Civilian involvement in warfare:** ""Total defense"" strategies involve civilians in national defense efforts, increasing their exposure to harm.
* **Data collection and targeting:** Civilian data (from phones, etc.) is used for intelligence gathering and targeting, raising serious privacy and ethical concerns.

**2. Accelerated Pace and Lethality of Warfare:** Technologies like AI, hypersonic weapons, and long-range strike systems are dramatically increasing the speed and lethality of warfare.  This speed reduces the time for human intervention and oversight, potentially leading to unintended consequences and violations of international humanitarian law (IHL).

**3. Challenges to International Humanitarian Law (IHL):** The rapid technological advancements challenge the core principles of IHL, particularly the principle of distinction (differentiating between military objectives and civilians).  The speed and automation of warfare make it difficult to apply proportionality and precaution in attacks.  Accountability for actions taken by autonomous systems is also a major concern.

**4. Three Overarching Trends:** The article identifies three interconnected trends shaping modern warfare:

* **Reduced Risk:**  Emphasis on force protection through uncrewed systems and long-range weapons.
* **Increased Lethality:**  Enhanced capabilities through AI, sensor networks, and multi-domain operations.
* **Growing Civilian Integration:**  Increased reliance on civilian technologies, infrastructure, and even direct civilian involvement in military efforts.


**5. Urgent Need for Safeguards:** The article stresses the urgent need to uphold IHL principles amidst these technological advancements.  It calls for greater consideration of humanitarian consequences, development of safeguards to reduce civilian harm, and a constant reevaluation of legal and ethical frameworks governing the use of new technologies in warfare.  The authors argue that IHL is not a burden but a necessary framework to navigate the complexities of modern warfare and protect civilians.


In essence, the article warns that while technology transforms *how* wars are fought, the fundamental human cost remains, and the existing legal and ethical frameworks must adapt and be rigorously applied to prevent further suffering.

OSU Agriculture IT team earns inaugural Bravo award for pioneering technology,"Bravo! Bravo! OSU Agriculture IT team earns inaugural Bravo award for pioneering technology Media Contact: Sophia Fahleson | Digital Communications Specialist | 405-744-7063 | sophia.fahleson@okstate.edu Behind every groundbreaking project is a team whose hard work might go unnoticed. In December 2024, the OSU Agriculture Information Technology Team received the inaugural Bravo Award for their preparation and ability to execute the technology plans for the new Agricultural Hall, a key facility to research and education. The team, however, was unaware they would receive an award. “It was a surreal moment because it was a huge surprise for all of us when our names were called to receive the Bravo Award,” said Mike Rasmussen, OSU Agriculture IT manager. IT teams are not used to having the spotlight on them, he added. Team members like to stay behind the computer and receive satisfaction from positive feedback from faculty and staff, he added. The Bravo Award recognized the OSU Agriculture IT team for their behind-the-scenes contributions that made Agricultural Hall operational, said Jayson Lusk, vice president and dean of OSU Agriculture. “The work included new technologies that advanced the educational opportunities for students,” said Dwayne Hunter, senior director of OSU Agriculture IT. The planning process to implement the technology infrastructure was monumental because of the timeliness of the project, Lusk said. “We were tasked with integrating technology that wasn’t used anywhere else on campus,” Hunter said. “It was a big challenge, but also it was a huge opportunity for us. “We had to ensure every system worked seamlessly and met the needs of both the faculty and students,” he added. “It was groundbreaking for our division, and it set a new standard for the kinds of tools we can provide.” The IT team got a first look at the building before moving technology to allow the team to approach this project appropriately, Hunter said. Faculty members had visions and goals they wanted to meet in the new building regarding technology, Rasmussen said. “We really listened to the faculty about what they needed in the new space,” Rasmussen said. “The five new computer labs were designed with that feedback in mind, and they are equipped with more advanced technology than ever before.” OSU Agriculture includes more than 150 faculty members, and each one has computers, monitors, and often multiple devices. For those moving into the new building, this technology had to be relocated and set up in a timely way, Lusk said. The challenge was not only moving the equipment but also ensuring the software functioned as seamlessly as it did before, Hunter said. The new computer labs needed to operate correctly — including a new agricultural communications classroom where Cowboy Journal is produced — and required entirely new systems, he added. This meant installing new computers, loading applications, and ensuring everything was properly set up, Lusk said. Despite the challenge, Hunter and Rasmussen had a solid team to support each other, Lusk said. Each person had a pivotal role, he added. Rasmussen was entrusted in setting up the computer labs, Hunter said. Other team members prepared faculty suites and huddle rooms. “Everyone had a clear role,” Hunter said. “Each person took ownership of their area. The real sense of teamwork made all the difference.” This dedication and teamwork brought about the surprise recognition, which the team received at the 2024 Annual Employee Appreciation Awards Luncheon. “We had no idea we were even getting the award,” Rasmussen said. “Dwayne Hunter just asked us to come to the luncheon, which is normal, so it took us completely by surprise.” Lusk knew the importance of recognizing IT’s contributions, he said. “The Bravo Award is a way to say thank you and job well done,” Lusk said. “I don’t think we do enough of that at times. Certainly, when we step back and think about the individuals or groups who are deserving of an extra pat on the back, IT was the first to come to mind.” Hunter was a bit uneasy about going on stage to receive the award, he said, but pleased because he felt the team’s efforts were appreciated. “I think to have that tangible recognition allows us to feel what we’ve done is valued,” Hunter said. “It shows the effort and energy we spent on the project was worth it.” With the Bravo Award now established, the OSU Agriculture IT team has set an example for departments and other college to follow, Rasmussen said. “Recognizing exceptional work helps set standards for excellence,” Hunter said. “It is a reminder that behind every successful project, there’s often a team making it all possible.” Story by Elena Santiago | Cowboy Journal","['Technology', 'Business', 'Education']","Unsung Heroes: OSU's IT Team Scores Big with Inaugural Bravo Award

EMILY NAJERA The full scale and potential environmental impacts of the developments aren’t known, because the footprint, energy needs, and water requirements are often closely guarded corporate secrets. Most of the companies didn’t respond to inquiries from MIT Technology Review, or declined to provide additional information about the projects. But there’s “a whole lot of construction going on,” says Kris Thompson, who served as the longtime project manager for the industrial center before stepping down late last year. “The last number I heard was 13 million square feet under construction right now, which is massive.” Indeed, it’s the equivalent of almost five Empire State Buildings laid out flat. In addition, public filings from NV Energy, the state’s near-monopoly utility, reveal that a dozen data-center projects, mostly in this area, have requested nearly six gigawatts of electricity capacity within the next decade. That would make the greater Reno area—the biggest little city in the world—one of the largest data-center markets around the globe. It would also require expanding the state’s power sector by about 40%, all for a single industry in an explosive growth stage that may, or may not, prove sustainable. The energy needs, in turn, suggest those projects could consume billions of gallons of water per year, according to an analysis conducted for this story. Construction crews are busy building data centers throughout the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center. EMILY NAJERA The build-out of a dense cluster of energy and water-hungry data centers in a small stretch of the nation’s driest state, where climate change is driving up temperatures faster than anywhere else in the country, has begun to raise alarms among water experts, environmental groups, and residents. That includes members of the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe, whose namesake water body lies within their reservation and marks the end point of the Truckee River, the region’s main source of water.","['Technology', 'Environment', 'Business']","Data Center Boom in Nevada's Desert: A Ticking Time Bomb?

31,https://news.umich.edu/motion-sickness-technology-could-alleviate-symptoms-for-passengers-in-todays-cars-and-tomorrows/,"Motion sickness technology could alleviate symptoms for passengers in today's cars, and tomorrow's","As Memorial Day trips near, new technology offers hope for those who get carsick Few weekends send more people on long car journeys than Memorial Day Weekend, with AAA estimating as many as 39 million people hitting the road this year. But unfortunately, motion sickness could make those trips uncomfortable and unpleasant for many people. Engineers at the University of Michigan have developed a new technology, ready for implementation in current vehicles, that reduces motion sickness by nearly half. For the 1 out of every 2 children and 1 in 3 adults who suffer from the condition, it’s an option that comes without the drowsiness of medications. U-M’s approach focuses on the cause of motion sickness—vehicle movements that catch passengers off-guard when they aren’t watching the road ahead. Called PREACT, the technology sends cues through the seat to alert those passengers to upcoming movements. It can also tilt the seat to mimic the way the body would naturally prepare for turning and braking if the passenger’s eyes were on the road to see what was coming. “We call it PREACT because it predicts the motions of the vehicle and acts preemptively to counteract the effect of the vehicle’s motion on the passenger’s body,” said Shorya Awtar, U-M professor of mechanical engineering and director of the Precision Systems Design Laboratory. “We take real-time and historical data from on-vehicle sensors to help anticipate the vehicle’s impending motions and use that to alert passengers to what’s coming.” Following five years of research, technology innovations and extensive human testing, PREACT is now making its way toward real-world implementation. In March, Awtar and Daniel Sousa Schulman, a doctoral candidate and PREACT’s chief engineer, worked with U-M’s Innovation Partnerships to found Motion Sync, a high-tech startup seeking to commercialize the technology. Motion Sync has begun working with a major auto manufacturer—a partnership designed to explore and demonstrate PREACT’s viability for the automaker’s vehicles. One version of the technology makes use of automatically tilting seats or tightening seat belts to prepare passengers for upcoming maneuvers. Such active seats and seatbelts would be integrated within the vehicle platform. Another version of the PREACT technology can be retrofitted on any existing vehicle. In this case, PREACT sends haptic cues to passengers in advance of turns, acceleration and braking so that they aren’t caught off-guard by their vehicle’s movements. A buzzing on the left side of the seat warns the occupant to prepare for a left turn, for instance. Schulman, Motion Sync’s CEO, said the retrofit haptic version adds only a few pounds to a vehicle, requires minimal power and comes at a low cost. “Users will be able to choose whatever PREACT version works best for their needs, an integrated version vs. a retrofit version,” he said. “This will make PREACT affordable and accessible to a wide range of customers.” PREACT’s research team tested the technology with over 150 human subjects at Mcity, using specially designed test vehicles operating on test tracks that simulate both city and highway driving. Results showed a statistically significant reduction in the subjects’ feelings of motion sickness, with 80% saying it’s a technology they would want included with their next vehicle purchase. PREACT would work in today’s human-driven vehicles, including electric and hybrid. Both charge batteries through regenerative braking, but this more aggressive deceleration leads to increases in motion sickness. And, just like ridesharing services such as Uber and Lyft, PREACT could help autonomous vehicles deliver on their promise of turning commutes and longer journeys into work or leisure time, enabling passengers to take their eyes off the road without experiencing motion sickness. “There are big questions out there: ‘Will users trust these autonomous vehicles or will there be a level of discomfort for people in these vehicles?'” Awtar said. “It’s vitally important we take into account the human factors associated with this if it’s to become the standard mode for transportation. Motion Sync is tackling some of these challenges and plans to have PREACT available to consumers in the near future.” The research was partially funded by the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Center for Connected and Automated Transportation and Michigan Translational Research and Commercialization for Advanced Transportation Innovation Hub.","['Technology', 'Automobiles', 'Transportation']","**Never Get Carsick Again: Revolutionary Tech Ends Travel Nausea**

33,https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250521/New-mask-technology-balances-protection-and-comfort-effectively.aspx,New mask technology balances protection and comfort effectively,"The COVID-19 pandemic increased public awareness of the importance of mask use for personal protection. However, when the mesh size of mask fabrics is small enough to capture viruses, which are usually around one hundred nanometers in size, the fabric typically also restricts air flow, resulting in user discomfort. But now, researchers from Japan have found a way to avoid this. In a study published this month in Materials Advances, researchers from the Institute of Industrial Science, The University of Tokyo have overcome this bottleneck and developed a filter capable of capturing nanoparticles such as viruses without greatly restricting air flow. They managed this feat through careful design of the pore structure in the filter. The filter is constructed from nanosheets consisting of an ordered mesh composed of porphyrins, which are flat, ring-shaped molecules with a central hole. The tiny holes in the porphyrin molecules are suitably sized to allow the easy passage of the small gas molecules in air while blocking the movement of larger particles, such as viruses. The nanosheets are then supported on a fabric modified with nanofibers containing pores of several hundred nanometers to form the filter. The porphyrin-based nanosheets are constructed through interfacial reactions that are driven by the movement of reactants caused by the gradient of surface tension at the air–solvent interface, known as the Marangoni effect. The nanosheets are then compressed and coated on nanofiber-modified fabric using a stamp method."" Kazuyuki Ishii, senior author The team tested their filter using the standard procedure used to test N95 face masks. The results of the particle filtration tests revealed that the filter effectively trapped particles that were as small as viruses. The filter achieved a particle filtration efficiency of 96%, which exceeds the requirement of 95% for an N95 face mask. ""Our porphyrin-based filter collected nanoparticles with a diameter as small as one hundred nanometers,"" explains senior author Kazuyuki Ishii. ""Importantly, the filter also showed minimal decrease of differential pressure in gas flow measurements. This indicates that the filter is capable of trapping particles as small as viruses, while barely restricting air flow."" The team's approach involving coating porous nanosheets on nanofibers is promising to provide materials capable of effectively filtering small particles like viruses while maintaining air flow to ensure both user comfort and protection.","['Science', 'Technology', 'Health']","**Breathe Easy: Japanese Scientists Crack the Code for Virus-Blocking, Breathable Masks**
",Japanese researchers have developed a new mask filter that effectively captures virus-sized particles (96% efficiency) while maintaining comfortable airflow.  This is achieved through a carefully designed porous structure using porphyrin-based nanosheets supported on nanofiber fabric.  The filter's high filtration efficiency and low air resistance surpasses the requirements of N95 masks. ,"Key Insights and Takeaways from the Article:

Should AI have a role?,"AI-assisted summary Outdated technology and staffing shortages at Newark Liberty International Airport have led to ongoing flight delays and cancellations. Experts warn that underfunding the FAA has prevented necessary technological upgrades and hiring of air traffic controllers. The Transportation Secretary proposed a program to modernize the system and incentivize hiring, but Congressional funding is still needed. Old technology is behind the recent ongoing delays and cancellations at Newark Liberty International Airport, but newer technology will be an important part of the solution. To recap, on April 28, air traffic controllers handling inbound traffic at Newark experienced a brief radar and radio outage. Similar failures have occurred at least three times since then, and in response, the Federal Aviation Administration and airlines have reduced the number of flights operating in and out of the airport. It's the kind of failure experts have been warning was inevitable for years. “All these issues of staffing, all these issues of using copper wires instead of fiber optics, these have been there for a long time,” Sheldon Jacobson, professor of computer science at the University of Illinois’ Grainger College of Engineering, told USA TODAY. Jacobson said the technology in air traffic control towers is largely outdated, but like an old car, it worked well until it started breaking down. Need a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle. “People are now paying attention,"" he said. “They put more airplanes in the sky than the system can absorb, and what’s happened is we've reached a tipping point. We have so much volume, and we have pretty much the same air traffic control technology for decades."" How did we get here? The FAA's air traffic control issues didn't develop overnight, although the current headaches at Newark did catch many travelers by surprise. Industry watchers have long warned that Congress was under-funding the FAA, preventing the agency from upgrading its technology and limiting its ability to hire and train new air traffic controllers. According to Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, the FAA is short about 3,000 air traffic controllers nationwide, and continues to rely on outdated technology like floppy disks to perform some crucial functions. Still, Jacobson said, that doesn't mean air travel isn't safe. “The FAA, the airlines, and all of the supporting people have worked diligently to make air travel safer, and it’s never been safer,"" he said. And that's part of the reason there are more delays and cancellations as air traffic control equipment falters. ""The only way to ensure the safety is to bring the volume down so we're not at that tipping point,"" Jacobson said. What solutions have been proposed? Successive administrations from both parties in Washington have promised fixes to the FAA's air traffic control program, but the solutions have been piecemeal so far. Duffy recently announced a sweeping program to upgrade the agency's technology infrastructure, as well as hiring incentives to entice more would-be air traffic controllers. However, a funding commitment from Congress was missing from his announcement. That hurdle has prevented previous administrations from implementing such overhauls. Even if lawmakers fund the Trump administration's proposals, implementing the upgrades will likely take a long time. “This isn’t going to happen in three years. This is going to take several years,” Jacobson said. “It’s expensive and time-consuming.” He also warned that it will add expense, complexity, and time because the upgrades will need to be rolled out without taking the current air traffic control system offline. “You’re trying to update a system while it’s still working,"" he said. Can AI help solve air traffic control issues? Eventually, the FAA will roll out new technology for air traffic control, and while Jacobson said air traffic controllers won't ever be fully replaced by computers, he did acknowledge that new tech has a role to play in optimizing the nation's airspace. “If we leave that off the table, we’re forcing ourselves to use more manpower,"" he said. Jacobson said that, since the FAA and airlines prioritize safety above all else, it doesn't make sense to remove humans from the air traffic control equation entirely. Pilots' unions have also long advocated the safety importance of having two highly trained aviators in the cockpit of every commercial flight, despite growing calls from some outside groups to explore flight control automation. However, using artificial intelligence and other technology to ease the controllers' burden could actually make the system safer. “There are a lot of very perfunctory tasks that, working with ATC, an AI system could direct airplanes to,"" Jacobson said, like issuing initial clearance for pilots to push back from their gates, or guiding them to the start of the taxiway. ""You don’t compromise safety, that is the most important objective, but you're giving them a little more breathing room or legroom to get their job done.""

","Outdated technology and a shortage of air traffic controllers at Newark Liberty International Airport are causing significant flight delays and cancellations.  Years of underfunding the FAA have prevented necessary technological upgrades and hiring, leading to a system nearing its breaking point.  While a proposed modernization program offers a solution, Congressional funding is crucial for its implementation. ","Key Insights and Takeaways from the Article on Newark Airport Delays:

* **Outdated Technology and Staffing Shortages are the Root Cause:**  Years of underfunding the FAA has resulted in outdated technology (including reliance on obsolete equipment like floppy disks) and a critical shortage of air traffic controllers (approximately 3,000 nationwide). This combination creates a fragile system prone to failures and delays, as exemplified by the recent outages at Newark Liberty International Airport.

* **A ""Tipping Point"" Has Been Reached:** The current system is overwhelmed by the volume of air traffic, exceeding its capacity to handle it safely and efficiently with the existing infrastructure.  The recent failures highlight that the system is operating at its breaking point.

* **Safety Remains a Priority, but Delays are Inevitable:** While air travel remains safe, the limitations of the current system necessitate reduced flight volume to maintain safety standards, leading to unavoidable delays and cancellations.

* **Proposed Solutions Require Congressional Funding:**  Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has proposed a comprehensive modernization program including technological upgrades and hiring incentives. However, the success of this plan hinges on securing necessary funding from Congress, a hurdle that has stalled similar initiatives in the past.  Even with funding, implementation will take years.

* **AI Can Play a Supporting Role, Not a Replacement:** While complete automation of air traffic control is unlikely due to safety concerns, AI could assist controllers by automating routine tasks, alleviating their workload and improving efficiency without compromising safety.  This would free up controllers to focus on more complex situations.

* **The Problem is Long-Standing and Complex:** The issues at Newark are not a sudden crisis but the culmination of years of underinvestment and neglect.  A swift, simple fix is unrealistic; a long-term, multi-faceted approach is required involving significant financial investment and time.

Asserted are five patents received as part of a larger portfolio from Panasonic in March 2024, and targeted is the provision of ""the BOE OLED panel supplied to Valve and included in the Steam Deck"" (a handheld gaming device) as well as ""the BOE display/touch panel supplied to Amazon and included in the Amazon Fire HD10 tablet"". Meanwhile, BOE Technology—in the first of two suits filed against it by Texas plaintiff Optronic Sciences LLC—has challenged subject matter jurisdiction, arguing that restrictions placed on the rights granted to the plaintiff by AUO reduce Optronic Sciences from patentee to licensee. As RPX has previously reported, Paneltouch Technologies was formed in Texas on July 11, 2023. In state records, Paneltouch Technologies identifies as its managing member Touch Display LLC, a Delaware entity formed one day earlier, on July 10, 2023. Texas state records also suggest that Paneltouch Technologies has secured funding; however, the identity of the funder has been obscured through the use of a corporate services company, which signed as that funder's representative. The management or personnel of Paneltouch Technologies does not appear in publicly available records. Optronic Sciences was formed in Texas on May 17, 2023. It identified as its managing member Lumina Innovations LLC, a Delaware entity formed one day earlier (with the same agent used by Touch Display), on May 16, 2023. Texas state records also suggest that Optronic Sciences has secured funding, the identity of the funder obscured through the use of the same corporate services company. Signing as the organizer of Optronic Sciences in Texas state records is Nat Smith, apparently an employee of Northwest Registered Agent, LLC, the same individual who signed as the organizer for Paneltouch Technologies. On March 22, 2024, Panasonic assigned more than 140 issued US patents to Paneltouch Technologies. The recipient has now sued BOE Technology over five of those received assets (8,704,762; 8,803,836; 9,250,758; 9,507,477; 11,126,025). The Eastern District of Texas complaint provides little detail as to either Paneltouch Technologies or Touch Display. Paneltouch Technologies is represented by Russ August & Kabat, frequent plaintiff-side counsel. The plaintiff has filed a disclosure statement in which it ""certifies that there is no parent corporation and that no publicly held corporation owns 10 percent or more of the interest in Paneltouch Technologies"". Per Texas state records, that certification appears incorrect. Indeed, in connection with its first case against BOE Technology, filed by Russ August & Kabat in November 2023, Optronic Sciences filed a disclosure statement in which it certified ""that there is no parent corporation and that no publicly held corporation owns 10 percent or more of the interest in Optronic Sciences LLC"". It later corrected that disclosure to indicate that ""Optronic Sciences is 100% owned by Lumina Innovations LLC"". The Optronic Sciences complaint, filed in the Eastern District of Texas, provides little detail as to either Optronic Sciences or Lumina Innovations. Optronic Sciences filed its second complaint against BOE in July 2024. There, the plaintiff filed an apparently incorrect disclosure (not identifying Lumina) and has yet to correct it. Optronic Sciences targets the provision of various LCD panels, including as integrated into certain Dell laptops and Hisense TVs, as well as OLED panels as integrated into the Apple iPhone 14. The NPE asserted nine patents received as part of a 200-patent portfolio from AUO to Optronic Sciences, assigned on August 2, 2023. The second complaint asserts four more of those received assets. BOE Technology has yet to challenge the plaintiff's standing to sue in the second case, as it has in the first. The exact contours of BOE's standing arguments are obscured by redactions from the public's view. Eastern District of Texas Chief Judge Rodney Gilstrap presides over both cases. Public records suggest that Optronic Sciences received funding for its litigation efforts, as of July 2023, but the identity of the backer is hidden, through the use of a corporate services organization First Corporate Solutions out of Sacramento, California. Likewise, Paneltouch Technologies also appears to have received funding for its campaign, as of February 2024. The identity of the backer is hidden, also through the use of First Corporate Solutions out of Sacramento, California. Note that a similar pattern—of tiered plaintiff ownership via an entity formed in the state of suit controlled by a Delaware entity itself created the day before, as well as publicly recorded backing by a third party using First Corporate Solutions as its representative—marks the campaign of SoundClear Technologies LLC, which has sued Alphabet (Google) and Amazon (Amazon Web Services), in Virginia instead of in Texas.

","Two Texas-based patent assertion entities, Paneltouch Technologies and Optronic Sciences, both represented by Russ August & Kabat, have sued BOE Technology in the Eastern District of Texas.  Paneltouch alleges BOE infringed five patents received from Panasonic, relating to displays in the Steam Deck and Amazon Fire HD10. Optronic Sciences' suits, targeting various LCD and OLED panels, face jurisdictional challenges from BOE due to licensing restrictions on the patents' origins from AUO;  both plaintiffs obscure their funding sources using a corporate services company. ","This article details two patent infringement lawsuits filed in the Eastern District of Texas against BOE Technology, a prominent display manufacturer.  The key insights and takeaways are:

* **Shell Companies and Patent Assertion Entities (PAEs):**  Two newly formed Texas-based PAEs, Paneltouch Technologies and Optronic Sciences, are suing BOE. Both are structured as shell companies, using Delaware entities as managing members and obscuring their funding sources through a corporate services company (First Corporate Solutions). This opaque structure is a common tactic among PAEs to protect the identities of their investors and limit liability.

* **Patent Acquisitions:** Both Paneltouch and Optronic Sciences acquired large portfolios of patents from major companies: Paneltouch from Panasonic (140+ patents, suing on 5) and Optronic Sciences from AUO (200+ patents, suing on 13 across two lawsuits). This highlights the trend of PAEs acquiring patents for litigation purposes.

* **Targets:**  The lawsuits target BOE's OLED and LCD panels used in various devices such as the Steam Deck, Amazon Fire HD10 tablet, Dell laptops, Hisense TVs, and Apple iPhone 14.

* **Jurisdictional Challenges:** BOE has challenged subject matter jurisdiction in one of the Optronic Sciences cases, arguing that AUO's restrictions on the granted rights reduce Optronic Sciences from patentee to licensee, thus lacking standing to sue. This raises questions about the validity of the PAE's standing in these cases.

* **Law Firm and Potential Coordination:**  Both lawsuits are handled by the same law firm, Russ August & Kabat, a firm known for representing plaintiffs in patent cases in the Eastern District of Texas. This suggests potential coordination or a shared backing between the two PAEs.

* **Inaccurate Disclosures:** Both Paneltouch and Optronic Sciences initially filed inaccurate disclosure statements regarding their ownership structure, further highlighting their lack of transparency.

* **Similar Patterns to Other PAEs:** The article draws parallels to another PAE, SoundClear Technologies, which also employs a similar structure and uses First Corporate Solutions to obscure funding. This suggests a possible pattern of PAE formation and litigation strategy.

**In short:** The article exposes a likely coordinated effort by several shell companies, likely backed by a hidden investor(s), to leverage acquired patent portfolios to pursue litigation against BOE in a jurisdiction known for being favorable to plaintiffs.  The use of opaque structures raises concerns about transparency and the potential for abusive litigation practices.

45,https://www.marketsmedia.com/quantum-technology-to-take-markets-to-mars/,Quantum Technology to Take “Markets to Mars”,"Daily Email Feature Quantum Technology to Take “Markets to Mars” This month JPMorgan Chase and technology company Infleqtion released a new open source quantum software library designed to improve the efficiency of potential applications and use cases. This reinforces the belief of Brad Levy, chief executive of Symphony, whichprovides four interconnected platforms for messaging, voice, directory and analytics (MVDA), that quantum computing will destabilize, and may invalidate, many foundations of business, including current encryption methods. Infleqtion said the new library addresses one of the biggest current barriers in quantum computing, which is the scale of hardware typically needed to achieve practical fault tolerance. The library allows between 10 and 100 times reductions in the number of physical qubits required to run quantum programs. Qubits enable computing exponentially faster than the classical systems based on binary logic. Pranav Gokhale, general manager of computing at Infleqtion, said in a statement: “Through our work with JPMorgan, we’re showing how software and hardware innovation, especially the flexibility of our Sqale quantum processor, can work together to move the financial industry toward commercial use of quantum computing faster.” The Symphony Innovate conference in London on 21 May 2025 included a panel on cybersecurity and quantum panel. Levy told Markets Media: “The undercurrent is that if we can’t figure out how to protect ourselves in a world of basic speed and binary technology, then we have to really be concerned about security and encryption.” In January last year the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the FCA, the UK regulator, published a white paper on a roadmap to inform global regulatory and industry approaches for a quantum secure financial sector.. The paper said the financial sector “stands on the brink of a transformation from a digital economy to a quantum economy.” In a blog in April 2025, Markets To Mars: How Quantum Will Change the Fabric of Finance Forever, Levy and Dietmar Fauser, chief information officer at Symphony, said quantum computing will destabilize and may invalidate current encryption methods, and will also accelerate artificial intelligence to unimaginable speeds. Scientists are still searching for the Theory of Everything, a single equation that can define both the large-scale cosmological structure of the universe and the quantum world. Levy and Fauser compared the entirety of interconnected global markets to the galaxy and said this global whole will undergo a revolutionary transformation with the advent of quantum computing. The galaxy is made up of solar systems, the equivalent of individual companies in this analogy, who will have to adapt all their financial workflows due to quantum technology. Further down, at the nano-market level, Symphony’s technology addresses granular details to ensure market liquidity and security. Levy argued that Symphony’s strength is its detailed understanding of market dynamics such as how collateral and margin is structured, and how repo and stock loan markets works. As a result, the firm is developing secure quantum-secure workflows that encrypt daily financial workflows at this nano-level to protect financial stability. Voice and messaging In addition to preparing for the development of quantum technology, voice and messaging is still important to Symphony. Levy said: “Voice is a big deal for us and we are pushing that product hard. It is still a massive opportunity in terms of people want to be secure and compliant” Symphony has combined its AI and domain expertise with Google Cloud’s transcription and generative artificial intelligence capabilities to enhance its Cloud9 voice product with speech-to-text fine-tuning and natural language processing (NLP) capabilities. Many banks have embedded Symphony’s Federation, which unifies popular mobile communication channels such as WhatsApp, SMS and WeChat in a secure and compliance-enabling interface, in their own platforms according to Levy. Contain, converge and collaborate Federation is an example of Symphony always putting security first as the firm looks to “contain, converge and collaborate”, according to Levy. Symphony has also been rolling out confidential cloud which allow firms to securely manage keys that decrypt messages in the cloud, rather than on premise. Levy compared moving data between the cloud and the edge, devices at or near the physical location of either the user or the source of the data, to yoga – people don’t get hurt in position but when they move to the next position. In terms of convergence, Symphony has made acquisitions such as Cloud9 which securely brings voice and messaging together. “People are also looking at being in multiple asset classes, at being public and private investors and investing in both Europe and the US,” said Levy. “Convergence is real.” Symphony also co-operates with relevant firms and Levy said the firm will be looking at more post-trade partnerships. In April 2025 Euroclear Bank said the collateral management services business is using Taskize, an investment operations collaboration platform, as well as its integrations with email and Symphony Messaging, to make query resolution faster and easier to manage.

57,https://www.coolingpost.com/world-news/nano-technology-brings-major-advance-in-thermoelectrics/,Nano technology brings major advance in thermoelectrics,"USA: Researchers in the US claim to have developed an easily manufacturable solid-state thermoelectric refrigeration technology that is twice as efficient as similar devices. This advancement, using nano-engineered materials, is said to offer a scalable alternative to traditional compressor-based refrigeration. In a paper published in Nature Communications, a team of researchers from the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland, and refrigeration engineers from Samsung Research, demonstrated improved heat-pumping efficiency and capacity in refrigeration systems. The increased efficiency is attributed to high-performance nano-engineered thermoelectric materials invented at APL known as controlled hierarchically engineered superlattice structures (CHESS). The CHESS technology is the result of 10 years of APL research in advanced nano-engineered thermoelectric materials and applications development. Initially developed for national security applications, the material has also been used for non-invasive cooling therapies for prosthetics and won an R&D 100 award in 2023. “This real-world demonstration of refrigeration using new thermoelectric materials showcases the capabilities of nano-engineered CHESS thin films,” said Rama Venkatasubramanian, principal investigator of the joint project and chief technologist for thermoelectrics at APL. “It marks a significant leap in cooling technology and sets the stage for translating advances in thermoelectric materials into practical, large-scale, energy-efficient refrigeration applications.” Thermoelectric refrigeration cools by using electrons to move heat through specialised semiconductor materials, eliminating the need for moving parts or refrigerants. Bulk thermoelectric materials are used in small devices like mini-fridges, but their limited efficiency, low heat-pumping capacity and incompatibility with scalable semiconductor chip fabrication have historically prevented their wider use in high-performance systems. In the study, researchers compared refrigeration modules using traditional bulk thermoelectric materials with those using CHESS thin-film materials in standardised refrigeration tests, measuring and comparing the electrical power needed to achieve various cooling levels in the same commercial refrigerator test systems. Researchers analyse thin films made to produce the CHESS materials. Photo: Johns Hopkins APL/Ed Whitman The refrigeration team from Samsung Research’s Life Solution Team collaborated with APL to validate the results through detailed thermal modelling, quantifying heat loads and thermal resistance parameters to ensure accurate performance evaluation under real-world conditions. Using CHESS materials, the APL team is said to have achieved nearly 100% improvement in efficiency over traditional thermoelectric materials at room temperature (around 25ºC). They then translated these material-level gains into a near 75% improvement in efficiency at the device level in thermoelectric modules built with CHESS materials and a 70% improvement in efficiency in a fully integrated refrigeration system, each representing a significant improvement over state-of-the-art bulk thermoelectric devices. These tests were completed under conditions that involved significant amounts of heat pumping to replicate practical operation. Built to scale Beyond improving efficiency, the CHESS thin-film technology uses remarkably less material — just 0.003 cubic centimeters, or about the size of a grain of sand, per refrigeration unit. This reduction in material means APL’s thermoelectric materials could be mass-produced using semiconductor chip production tools, driving cost efficiency and enabling widespread market adoption. “This thin-film technology has the potential to grow from powering small-scale refrigeration systems to supporting large building HVAC applications, similar to the way lithium-ion batteries have been scaled to power devices as small as mobile phones and as large as electric vehicles,” Venkatasubramanian said. These materials and devices continue to show promise for a broad range of energy-harvesting and electronics applications in addition to the recent advances in refrigeration. APL plans to continue to partner with organizations to refine the CHESS thermoelectric materials with a focus on boosting efficiency to approach that of conventional mechanical systems. Future efforts include demonstrating larger-scale refrigeration systems, including freezers, and integrating artificial intelligence-driven methods to optimise energy efficiency in compartmentalised or distributed cooling in HVACR equipment.","['Technology', 'Science', 'Business']","Revolutionizing Cooling:  Sand-Sized Tech Doubles Refrigeration Efficiency

The technology's small material requirement allows for mass production using semiconductor chip fabrication methods. ","Key Insights and Takeaways from the Article:

* **Significant Efficiency Improvement in Solid-State Refrigeration:** Researchers have developed a new thermoelectric material (CHESS) that dramatically improves the efficiency of solid-state refrigeration.  It's approximately twice as efficient as existing similar technologies. This improvement is seen at the material, module, and fully integrated system levels.

* **Scalable and Manufacturable Technology:** Unlike previous thermoelectric materials, CHESS is designed for scalability. Its thin-film nature (requiring minimal material) allows for mass production using existing semiconductor manufacturing techniques, significantly reducing costs and paving the way for widespread adoption.

* **Nano-engineered Materials are Key:** The high efficiency is directly attributed to the nano-engineered CHESS (controlled hierarchically engineered superlattice structures) material, which has been under development for a decade.

* **Real-World Application Demonstrated:** The research isn't just theoretical; the team successfully integrated CHESS into a working refrigeration system and tested it under real-world conditions in collaboration with Samsung.  The results demonstrate a substantial performance increase compared to traditional thermoelectric systems.

64,https://www.cleanroomtechnology.com/today-s-highlights-day-2-at-the-cleanroom-technology,Today's highlights: Day 2 at the Cleanroom Technology Conference 2025,"The second day of the Cleanroom Technology Conference has now kicked off! There was a fantastic buzz around the hall following the previous night's quiz and networking drinks. The Ansell-sponsored session saw the quizmaster dressed in a cleanroom gown, to the delight of delegates. Exhibitors were going ready and waiting going into the second day, many with solid leads. So spirits were high among all delegates. Moving into the conference, the day started off with a talk from Tim Triggs from ATi on cleanroom testing and operations. Triggs pointed out some old terminology still being used that we should be phasing out such as laminar air flow, and newer terminology that is gaining traction, such as first air. The Q&A session for Triggs saw many good conversations, too, about equipment qualifications, alarm delays, and more. Next up on the day's agenda was Steve Marnach from DuPont. Marnach gave a talk about validating protective cleanroom garments, with regard to the 2022 GMP Annex 1. Marnach told delegates that with the new Annex 1, when you have microbial growth in a Grade A cleanroom, you need to understand where it is coming from. Marnach referenced a recent study from Dr Laurie Smith, who did this and found that 90% was from operators. This underlines the importance of garment qualification. To add a piece to this puzzle, Marnach also stressed how important it is to look at your garments' filtration efficiency when they are well-used, not just when they are new. Andrew Wert from CertAir was next up giving a talk about AI and robotics in cleanroom certification. Wert spoke about product design with regard to these. The air quality expert spoke about an often unacknowledged fact that what people say vs what they do can be totally different things. When designing an automation product, you need to observe people without them knowing that you are observing them. ""How people actually perform a task can vary from what they would present to you,"" he said. Automation can be a game-changer for this problem. Wert spoke about the filter integrity testing automated product that they provide and how compared it to manual processes. But he says they are by far not the only ones. ""38% of new sterile pharma productionslines since 2022 use robots,"" he says. The conference is ongoing, so stay tuned for more updates on the conference today!","['Technology', 'Business', 'Science']","Cleanroom Revolution: AI, New Terminology, and the Shocking Source of Contamination

65,https://pharmaphorum.com/rd/solution-spotlight-supply-chain-and-logistics-visibility-technology,Solution Spotlight: Supply chain and logistics visibility technology,"Tive is a global leader in supply chain and logistics visibility technology. 1,000 global shippers, logistics service providers, and retailers use Tive to monitor shipment location and condition in real time, gain actionable insights, and ensure end-customer satisfaction. Tive’s cloud platform, patented sensor technology, and 24/7 monitoring services reduce excursions and delays, minimise rejected loads, and decrease theft, damage, and spoilage - because every shipment matters. What problem or status quo deficiency are you solving? The world of pharma logistics has been limited to identifying temperature excursions that cause medicines to degrade. If excursions happen, these medicines go to waste and need to be replaced. The pharmaceutical industry has taken time to evaluate new technologies that provide real-time temperature monitoring, and which enable them to be proactive in the event of excursions. Real-time tracking enables customers to monitor temperature and other causes of damage, and to proactively take action in case of excursions - helping save medicines before they are compromised. To support this, Tive recently announced the Solo Pro, a validated, real-time visibility tracker for biologics and pharmaceutical shipments, designed to streamline product releases, reduce excursions, achieve compliance, and protect product integrity from point of origin to point of delivery. What has made this problem challenging to address in the past? The pharmaceutical industry is very conservative, and change in management control is difficult to initiate and implement. As such, the industry has been a late adopter of new technologies. It is also highly regulated, and approved and validated processes are difficult to change - and evaluating new technologies takes a lot of time. The pharma supply chain is quite robust, and disruptions are rare, which has not built an urgency to find new methods of cold chain management. Recently, however, disruptions are becoming the norm, and pharma logistics companies have been forced to evaluate more efficient ways to monitor the integrity of medicines.   What new innovations does your solution bring to bear on these challenges? New sensing technology enables customers to monitor not only temperature, but to detect when medicine is mishandled, which could risk integrity. Geolocalisation also empowers shippers to have better control over the safest, most effective routes - reducing the risk of delays, loss, theft, and counterfeiting. In addition, as information and alerts are captured in real time, teams can proactively take action to save shipments. This is handled by logistic providers, but the Tive team can also actively intervene in the event of route deviations or excursions. How does your solution work? Tive’s IoT devices capture real-time temperature, humidity, shock, light, tilt, and geolocalisation, and this data is available to LSPs and/or pharmaceutical manufacturers in the Tive platform. Alerts can be set to warn that an incident has occurred, and alerts are immediately sent to stakeholders to empower action. Users can also perform post-shipment analysis to improve the efficiency of their supply chain. Finally, if a customer requires it, we provide 24/7 Managed Services to monitor a specific shipment and take action in case any alerts take place. What makes your solution stand out in the market? The logistics world today is 24/7, taking proactive action in case of incidents, and ensuring that Tive’s real-time, IoT device connectivity is reliable - and global - is crucial. To achieve this, Tive has achieved device approval on 170+ air carriers, as well as across countries, cities, and airports, and global connectivity agreements are also essential. Because sustainability is becoming more important, Tive includes a reverse logistics programme, the Tive Green Program, in the United States and Europe, with further global expansion plans underway. Finally, we have sold more than two million Tive trackers, and have gathered immense amounts of data that contribute to shipment optimisation.   How would you quantify the economic ROI of your solution? Sometimes, saving even one shipment can save a company 100x on its investment. Tive not only monitors shipments in real time, users are empowered to take proactive action when alerted to an event that could damage product integrity. On average, 8% of shipments (across all industries) experience problems with damage, loss, and theft - all of which create waste and financial losses. Real-time visibility tools like Tive significantly reduce this percentage, and your ROI can be easily calculated and well justified. What do your customers have to say about this solution? We have received extremely positive feedback about our new Solo Pro trackers, in part because the device was designed using input from customers, which are not only specialty LSPs, but also pharmaceutical and biologics manufacturers. We also took into consideration biotech companies specialising in cell & gene therapies, which have extra complex supply chains. Users are saying that the Solo Pro is the most sophisticated - and easy to operate - device available on the market. Customers also praise the continuous improvement of Tive’s platform, which enables customers to manage their shipments in real time, and the ability to use historical shipment data to optimise future shipments. The general response has been excitement, as the Solo Pro not only enables pharma companies to protect shipments, it also accelerates releases seamlessly and safely.

71,https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/19/1116614/hao-empire-ai-openai/,Inside the story that enraged OpenAI,"At the time, few people beyond the insular world of AI research knew about OpenAI. But as a reporter at MIT Technology Review covering the ever‑expanding boundaries of artificial intelligence, I had been following its movements closely. Until that year, OpenAI had been something of a stepchild in AI research. It had an outlandish premise that AGI could be attained within a decade, when most non‑OpenAI experts doubted it could be attained at all. To much of the field, it had an obscene amount of funding despite little direction and spent too much of the money on marketing what other researchers frequently snubbed as unoriginal research. It was, for some, also an object of envy. As a nonprofit, it had said that it had no intention to chase commercialization. It was a rare intellectual playground without strings attached, a haven for fringe ideas. But in the six months leading up to my visit, the rapid slew of changes at OpenAI signaled a major shift in its trajectory. First was its confusing decision to withhold GPT‑2 and brag about it. Then its announcement that Sam Altman, who had mysteriously departed his influential perch at YC, would step in as OpenAI’s CEO with the creation of its new “capped‑profit” structure. I had already made my arrangements to visit the office when it subsequently revealed its deal with Microsoft, which gave the tech giant priority for commercializing OpenAI’s technologies and locked it into exclusively using Azure, Microsoft’s cloud‑computing platform. Each new announcement garnered fresh controversy, intense speculation, and growing attention, beginning to reach beyond the confines of the tech industry. As my colleagues and I covered the company’s progression, it was hard to grasp the full weight of what was happening. What was clear was that OpenAI was beginning to exert meaningful sway over AI research and the way policymakers were learning to understand the technology. The lab’s decision to revamp itself into a partially for‑profit business would have ripple effects across its spheres of influence in industry and government. So late one night, with the urging of my editor, I dashed off an email to Jack Clark, OpenAI’s policy director, whom I had spoken with before: I would be in town for two weeks, and it felt like the right moment in OpenAI’s history. Could I interest them in a profile? Clark passed me on to the communications head, who came back with an answer. OpenAI was indeed ready to reintroduce itself to the public. I would have three days to interview leadership and embed inside the company. Brockman and I settled into a glass meeting room with the company’s chief scientist, Ilya Sutskever. Sitting side by side at a long conference table, they each played their part. Brockman, the coder and doer, leaned forward, a little on edge, ready to make a good impression; Sutskever, the researcher and philosopher, settled back into his chair, relaxed and aloof. I opened my laptop and scrolled through my questions. OpenAI’s mission is to ensure beneficial AGI, I began. Why spend billions of dollars on this problem and not something else? Brockman nodded vigorously. He was used to defending OpenAI’s position. “The reason that we care so much about AGI and that we think it’s important to build is because we think it can help solve complex problems that are just out of reach of humans,” he said.","['Technology', 'Business', 'Science']","OpenAI's Billion-Dollar Gamble: From Nonprofit Utopia to Microsoft's Plaything
","Initially a relatively unknown AI research lab with unconventional goals and funding, OpenAI underwent a significant transformation, marked by a shift to a capped-profit model, a partnership with Microsoft, and increased public attention.  This pivot, fueled by controversial decisions and rapid changes, positioned OpenAI to exert considerable influence on both AI research and policy.  The author's visit and resulting profile captured this pivotal moment in the company's history, highlighting its ambitious goals and the ensuing debate surrounding its approach. ","Key insights and takeaways from the article:

* **OpenAI's Shift from Nonprofit Idealism to For-Profit Reality:**  The article highlights OpenAI's dramatic transformation from a relatively unknown, non-profit AI research lab with an ambitious (and doubted) goal of achieving AGI within a decade, to a major player in the AI industry attracting significant attention and controversy.

These inefficiencies directly impact merchant margins, liquidity, and scalability. Despite a crowded landscape of payment platforms, few effectively integrate cryptocurrency in a way that addresses these core issues. Coinsub Technology fills this critical gap with an infrastructure-first approach tailored for the next generation of commerce. In 2024, cryptocurrency transfer volumes—driven by stablecoins, a type of digital currency pegged to traditional assets like the US dollar—reached an astonishing $27.6 trillion, surpassing the combined transaction volumes of Visa and Mastercard. Looking ahead, Standard Chartered forecasts the stablecoin market could grow to $2 trillion by 2028. These trends reflect the accelerating demand for efficient, blockchain-based payment solutions. According to a recent report from a16z, a premier venture capital firm renowned for investing in breakthrough technologies across AI, crypto, and fintech, international remittances via traditional payment methods can incur up to 10% in fees, with settlement requiring over three to seven days to clear. With Coinsub Technology, the same outcome can be achieved at a fraction of the cost and time. Coinsub Technology’s advanced infrastructure empowers businesses to seamlessly manage products, issue invoices, and receive payments instantly. Designed for global reach, its checkout system enables merchants to tap into new customer segments around the world with ease. For example, businesses that adopt Coinsub Technology can now serve customers in regions like rural Nigeria, where internet access is widespread but traditional banking services remain limited.

78,https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-25-107335,Human Organ-On-A-Chip: Technologies Offer Benefits Over Animal Testing but Challenges Limit Wider Adoption,"What GAO Found Human organ-on-a-chip (OOC) is an emerging technology that incorporates human adult cells in a small laboratory device to mimic how organs work—such as the brain, heart, or lungs. OOCs may be designed to simulate the mechanics of human organs, such as a lung-on-a-chip that stretches to simulate breathing. Researchers are developing and using OOCs to model diseases and predict responses to chemicals. For example, companies are using OOCs to assess aspects of drug safety and efficacy. Because OOCs contain human cells, their use in research may have more relevance to humans than animal testing or other conventional lab methods, but certain OOC research may cost more and take longer. Currently, OOCs cannot replace animal testing but may be used alongside animals. The next generation of OOC is focused on developing “body-on-a-chip” systems that link together multiple OOCs—such as the intestine, liver, and kidney—to investigate how organs interact. Lung-on-a-chip (left) and how organ-on-a-chip compares to animals (right) GAO identified several challenges to the development and use of OOCs, including Obtaining human cells. Reliable human cells are a key requirement for using OOCs, but availability is limited. For example, experts told GAO that only 10 percent to 20 percent of human cells they purchase are high enough quality for OOC studies. Lack of benchmarks and validation studies. The lack of benchmarks and sufficient studies assessing OOC accuracy, reliability, and relevance hinders the ability of end users, such as drug companies, to understand how OOCs compare to conventional methods, including animals, and data from clinical trials. Limited data sharing. OOC developers and end users may be reluctant or lack capacity to share their OOC research findings. For example, companies may be concerned about intellectual property and loss of competitive advantages. Regulatory uncertainties. Regulators are still working to better understand OOCs. Meanwhile, experts told GAO that the OOC field faces regulatory uncertainties, including regulators’ lower level of familiarity with OOCs than other methods, and unclear guidance and messaging from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. GAO developed six policy options that could help mitigate challenges to OOC development and use, including the option to maintain the status quo. The options identify possible actions by policymakers, including legislative bodies, government entities, academia, industry, and other groups. See tables 1–6 in this report for additional policy options and details. Selected Policy Options to Help Mitigate Challenges to the Development and Use of Organ-on-a-Chip (OOC) Technologies Selected policy option Opportunities Considerations Support efforts to increase access to diverse, high-quality human cells (report p. 25) For example, federal entities, together with stakeholders from academia and industry, could support the establishment of high-quality cell banks and biospecimen repositories that incorporate population diversity. Could provide OOC developers and end users with a supply of diverse human cells for future OOC research. Current efforts to establish cell banks for related technologies may provide a model for these efforts. May require a high level of stakeholder coordination, additional resources, and scientific expertise. May require additional standardized cell protocols and reference materials. Encourage more research and development of benchmarks and validation studies (report p. 27) For example, relevant funding agencies could provide more funding to academics and companies for OOC research, specifically to validate OOCs for priority contexts of use. Could help to identify relevant benchmarks to validate OOCs for specific contexts of use. Could increase the number of published validation studies. Could increase scientific confidence in OOCs. Investments in OOCs may reduce available funding for other technologies. Defining priority contexts of use will require input from and coordination with end users, such as drug or chemical companies. Create or participate in mechanisms for data sharing (report p. 28) For example, OOC developers and drug companies could participate in precompetitive efforts to share OOC data freely, such as sharing data through an industry trade group, nonprofit, or other trusted third party. Could help end users and regulators assess the robustness of OOC. Could build confidence in and aid adoption of OOC. Could increase alignment and engagement among relevant stakeholders. Companies may need additional incentives to participate for fear of losing a competitive advantage. May require an assessment of which OOC methods would be most likely to benefit. Provide additional regulatory guidance (report p. 29) For example, regulators could provide detailed guidance on how specific OOCs could more readily replace a conventional laboratory method. Clarity from regulators on appropriate use cases within their regulatory purview could build confidence in the models and increase regulatory experience with these data. This approach may not be helpful for certain OOC use cases. Could require regulatory agencies to dedicate resources to these new efforts. Guidance that is too specific could constrain developers and end users. Source: GAO. | GAO-25-107335 Why GAO Did This Study Biomedical researchers face challenges investigating human biology, disease, and the body’s responses to external chemicals, including medicines. Conventional methods—such as animal testing and cells in a petri dish—often do not translate into similar results for humans because they cannot effectively replicate the complex systems of the human body. In the past decade, however, researchers in the pharmaceutical, chemical, and biodefense industries have begun developing and using OOCs to help improve our understanding of human disease and responses to drugs and other chemicals. This technology assessment examines (1) current and emerging OOC technologies and their potential benefits, (2) challenges to developing and using these technologies, and (3) options that policymakers could consider to help enhance the benefits or mitigate the challenges. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed scientific literature and federal agency documents; interviewed a range of experts from government, industry, academia, and nonprofit organizations; and convened a discussion group of 16 experts. Participants included federal agency officials, policy experts, and OOC developers and end users from industry and academia. GAO is identifying policy options in this report (see next page).

","Organ-on-a-chip (OOC) technology uses human cells to mimic organ function, offering a potentially more relevant alternative to animal testing for drug development and disease modeling.  However, challenges remain, including limited access to high-quality human cells, a lack of standardized validation studies, and regulatory uncertainty.  The GAO report identifies several policy options to address these challenges and promote wider adoption of OOC technology. ","The GAO report on Organ-on-a-Chip (OOC) technology reveals several key insights and takeaways:

**Key Insights:**

* **OOC's Promise:** OOC technology, mimicking human organs in miniature, offers a potentially more relevant alternative to animal testing and traditional cell cultures for drug safety and efficacy assessments, disease modeling, and understanding human responses to chemicals.  The technology's use of human cells makes it potentially more predictive of human responses.  Future ""body-on-a-chip"" systems aim to integrate multiple OOCs to study organ interactions.

* **Current Limitations:**  Despite its promise, OOC technology faces significant hurdles.  These include:
    * **Limited Availability of High-Quality Human Cells:**  A major bottleneck is the scarcity of reliable human cells suitable for OOC research.
    * **Lack of Benchmarks and Validation:**  The absence of standardized benchmarks and rigorous validation studies hinders the acceptance and widespread adoption of OOC data by researchers and regulatory bodies.  It's difficult to compare OOC results to traditional methods without solid validation.
    * **Limited Data Sharing:** Concerns over intellectual property and competitive advantages hinder the sharing of OOC research data, slowing progress and hindering validation efforts.
    * **Regulatory Uncertainty:**  Regulatory agencies still lack a full understanding of OOCs and haven't developed clear guidance for their use and regulatory acceptance.

81,https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatacenter/news/366624166/Dell-Technologies-customers-building-real-world-AI-apps,Dell Technologies customers building real-world AI apps,"LAS VEGAS -- AI implementations beyond mere chatbot interactions with large language models have permeated the data centers of Dell Technologies World attendees this year. These implementations have moved into production, as these organizations attempt to sustain real-world uses beyond customer support or querying a knowledge base. Enterprises that have yet to fully embrace AI technology or processes are going to be left behind in the market, said Jeff Clarke, Dell Technologies vice chairman and chief operating officer, during the Day 2 keynote Wednesday. ""This is the most disruptive technology I've seen in my career,"" he said. ""The threat [to your organization] is existential if you don't respond."" At the keynote, the vendor pitched its Dell AI Factory offering and recent storage hardware refreshes as data center upgrades that will empower AI development for hybrid-cloud uses. Dell executives at the keynote also confirmed the new parallel file system, codenamed Project Lighting for the past year, would launch to general availability before year's end. Project Lighting is a software-defined file system built for Dell PowerEdge server hardware, specifically tested on the R660 model. Currently in limited testing, it's similar in concept to offerings from competitors such as DataDirect Networks, Weka and Lustre. Companies will upgrade for AI workloads, CEO Michael Dell said during a media and analyst Q&A following the keynote. However, upgrading to this new hardware might not happen quickly for many customers who are dealing with uncertain economic factors, particularly North America and its ongoing tariff dispute, he said. Dell asserted that the cost of compute to create the tokens that power the underlying large language model (LLM) technology is more prohibitive. ""The importance of this technology is greater than all those problems,"" Dell said. ""Tokens are bigger than tariffs, that would summarize our view of it."" Even when backed by high-end hardware or software, AI initiatives shouldn't be implemented haphazardly, Clarke said, echoing the sentiments of organizations already using AI in production. Instead, customers should start small, find what works and scale quickly to business needs to avoid wasting time, hardware and resources, he said. ""If you apply AI to a shitty process, you just get a shitty answer faster,"" Clarke said. AI implementations Dauntless XR, a Texas-based company specializing in augmented and virtual reality software, is using AI for object recognition and creating digital twins of atmospheres. Lori-Lee Elliott Lori-Lee Elliott Lori-Lee Elliott, co-founder and CEO of Dauntless XR, said these implementations are also complemented by a more traditional use with content generation using company data. For her, AI use needs to move beyond the chat room visualization and into uses that directly support an organization's business and workers seamlessly. ""When a lot of people think of AI, they think of LLMs,"" Elliott said. ""The end state of [our AI initiatives] -- and we're not quite there yet -- [is Dauntless XR having] a single platform where all of this data lives eventually."" Recent AI marketing hype around Generative AI has buried the decades of prior research and real-world uses of AI, said Chris Sullivan, director of research and academic computing at the Oregon State University College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences. His department's research into AI involves demanding high-performance computing (HPC) uses, such as mapping ocean wildlife changes over centuries, photographic research and monitoring of microscopic krill and geographic information systems. The underlying mathematics and science behind today's AI have existed for decades, but recent advances in connectivity and memory have made the implementation far more feasible and usable to the public. Chris Sullivan Chris Sullivan ""The number of times I've heard someone say AI and have no clue about what they're doing is stunning,"" Sullivan said. ""People don't understand the term AI and misuse it so badly that it's become an umbrella that's flipped upside down and catches everything."" The actual bottleneck most organizations will encounter in their AI ambitions comes down to data, he said. Many organizations treat data as a black box and expect off-the-shelf LLMs to help make sense of the digital detritus that has built up over the years. Many organizations might not even realize their data is ultimately lacking for AI uses, Sullivan said. ""What we really need to do is start the AI down the pathway of data management and put agents in that place to help us understand what's there,"" he said. ""We need [AI data] to be presented in a way that people can leverage it.""","['Technology', 'Business', 'Economy']","AI: Evolve or Die.
","Dell Technologies World showcased the increasing adoption of AI beyond chatbots, with companies moving AI into production for real-world applications.  Dell emphasized the urgency of AI adoption, highlighting its new AI Factory offering and Project Lighting parallel file system to facilitate this transition, while cautioning against haphazard implementation and stressing the importance of starting small and scaling strategically.  However, challenges remain, including economic uncertainties and the crucial need for effective data management to unlock the full potential of AI initiatives.

84,https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/laser-printed-batteries-sulfur-chemistry/,Scientists make intriguing breakthrough in battery technology using laser pulses: 'A critical research subject',"""A way to combine these processes into a single step at nanosecond speeds."" Lasers are used to perform precise surgeries and have been the weapon of choice for fictional supervillains. Now, experts from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology are using the beams to build advanced batteries, according to a news release. The laser-printing technique has shown potential to accelerate the production of lithium-sulfur packs, a lithium-ion alternative being worked on in labs around the world. Advantages include more energy storage per pound. Sulfur is also nontoxic and is acquired at a lower cost compared to metals used in common batteries. But a shorter lifespan, poor conductivity, and degrading volume expansion have been hurdles, all according to Chinese battery maker UFine. The company isn't involved with the Hong Kong project. University experts have already advanced their laser technique with a simplified approach to make sulfur-based cathodes for pouch and coin cell packs. Ions move between the anode and cathode inside cells during charge/discharge cycles. Current cathode production includes a complex process with varied temperatures. It can be costly and time-consuming, sometimes lasting several days. Laser pulses used as part of a single-step method are showing promise as a much shorter replacement, all per the release. The process involves sulfur, a porous carbon layer, and halloysite-based hybrid nanotubes, serving as the active material, the conducting material, and the host, respectively. The parts are laser printed on a ""fabric acceptor,"" which has ""demonstrated outstanding performance in … lithium-sulfur cells,"" the report added. ""Our … technology offers a way to combine these processes into a single step at nanosecond speeds,"" assistant professor Mitch LI Guijun, who developed the technique, said. A video clip shared by Hong Kong shows a robotic arm moving the rectangular-shaped fabric, which then gets peppered with laser pulses. A pouch cell can be made in 20 minutes and can power a small screen, according to the release. Project first author Yang Rongliang summed up the ""thermal phenomenon"" caught on camera: ""The irradiated materials undergo a complex transient heating and cooling process, with … temperatures reaching up to thousands of degrees Kelvin. The precursor materials decompose, and the decomposed particles recombine to form new materials."" Lasers are involved in fascinating tech outside of batteries, as well. Seattle's Carbon Robotics has created a farm machine called LaserWeeder that selectively torches 100,000 weeds an hour with help from artificial intelligence. At the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, experts are using lasers to turn planet-warming carbon dioxide into cleaner synthetic fuels. It's all part of the way we can use technology to aid the shift to a planet-friendly future. Reduced air pollution will help almost everyone, as the World Health Organization reported that 99% of the population breathes poor air that increases risks for respiratory and other health problems. An easy way to help, part of an overall strategy to save money and cut air pollution at home, is to simply unplug the chargers and devices you aren't using. The energy vampires suck up loads of power, and you can bank $165 annually by pulling the plug. In Hong Kong, the team is confident that its research is based in a critical sector needed to power the future. The sulfur chemistry is also being eyed by vehicle-making juggernaut Stellantis to improve electric vehicle performance, as an example of another effort that could soon make a real-world difference, Reuters reported. ""The growing energy demands of modern society have made rechargeable batteries a critical research subject,"" the university's experts said in an abstract published by Nature.

89,https://blog.google/technology/ai/io-2025-keynote/,Google I/O 2025: From research to reality,"Project Mariner → Agent Mode We think of agents as systems that combine the intelligence of advanced AI models with access to tools, so they can take actions on your behalf and under your control. Our early research prototype, Project Mariner, is an early step forward in agents with computer-use capabilities to interact with the web and get stuff done for you. We released it as an early research prototype in December, and we’ve made a lot of progress since with new multitasking capabilities — and a method called “teach and repeat,” where you can show it a task once and it learns plans for similar tasks in the future. We're bringing Project Mariner’s computer use capabilities to developers via the Gemini API. Trusted testers like Automation Anywhere and UiPath are already starting to build with it, and it will be available more broadly this summer. Computer use is part of a broader set of tools we’ll need to build for an agent ecosystem to flourish. Like our open Agent2Agent Protocol, so that agents can talk to each other, or the Model Context Protocol introduced by Anthropic, so agents can access other services. And today, we're excited to announce that our Gemini API and SDK are now compatible with MCP tools. We’re also starting to bring agentic capabilities to Chrome, Search and in the Gemini app. For example, a new Agent Mode in the Gemini app will help you get even more done. If you’re apartment hunting, it will help find listings that match your criteria on websites like Zillow, adjust filters and use MCP to access the listings and even schedule a tour for you. An experimental version of Agent Mode in the Gemini app will be coming soon to subscribers. And it’s great for companies like Zillow, bringing in new customers and improving conversion rates. This is a new and emerging area, and we’re excited to explore how best to bring the benefits of agents to users and the ecosystem more broadly.","['Technology', 'Business', 'Finance']","**Your AI Assistant Just Got Superpowers: Introducing Gemini Agent Mode**
","Google's Project Mariner, an AI agent capable of web interaction and task completion, is being integrated into the Gemini API and app.  This agent utilizes a ""teach and repeat"" learning method and will soon feature an ""Agent Mode"" for tasks like apartment hunting, leveraging tools like MCP for enhanced functionality.  The company is expanding its agent ecosystem through collaborations and open protocols to foster broader development and adoption. ","Key insights and takeaways from the article about Project Mariner and Agent Mode:

* **Agent technology is advancing:** Google is developing agent technology (Project Mariner) that combines AI with tool access to perform tasks on behalf of users.  This goes beyond simple AI models and involves actual interaction with the real world via tools and APIs.

* **Project Mariner is maturing:** Initially a research prototype, Mariner now boasts enhanced multitasking and a ""teach and repeat"" learning mechanism, making it more efficient and adaptable.

* **Developer access via Gemini API:** Google is making Mariner's computer-use capabilities available to developers via its Gemini API, enabling third-party integrations and app development.

* **Agent ecosystem development:** Google is investing in the broader agent ecosystem, including inter-agent communication (Agent2Agent Protocol) and integration with other services like Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP).  This signifies a push towards a collaborative and interoperable agent landscape.

* **Agent Mode in Gemini App:**  A key application of this technology is the upcoming Agent Mode within Google's Gemini app. This allows users to automate complex tasks like apartment hunting, leveraging web scraping, filter adjustment, and service access via MCP.

* **Broader impact and benefits:** The technology benefits both users (through task automation) and businesses (like Zillow, through increased customer engagement and conversion rates).

* **Early stages, but promising:** The article emphasizes that agent technology is still emerging, but Google is actively exploring and expanding its capabilities and integration with existing services.  The focus is on responsible and beneficial deployment.

The firm is bundling most of its multimodal models into its Gemini app, including the new Imagen 4 image generator and the new Veo 3 video generator. That means you can now access Google’s full range of generative models via a single chatbot. It also announced Gemini Live, a feature that lets you share your phone’s screen or your camera’s view with the chatbot and ask it about what it can see. Those features were previously only seen in demos of Project Astra, a “universal AI assistant“ that Google DeepMind is working on. Now, Google is inching toward putting Project Astra into the hands of anyone with a smartphone. Google is also rolling out AI Mode, an LLM-powered front end to search. This can now pull in personal information from Gmail or Google Docs to tailor searches to users. It will include Deep Search, which can break a query down into hundreds of individual searches and then summarize the results; a version of Project Mariner, Google DeepMind’s browser-using agent; and Search Live, which lets you hold up your camera and ask it what it sees. This is the new frontier. It’s no longer about who has the most powerful models, but who can spin them into the best products. OpenAI’s ChatGPT includes many similar features to Gemini’s. But with its existing ecosystem of consumer services and billions of existing users, Google has a clear advantage. Power users wanting access to the latest versions of everything on display can now sign up for Google AI Ultra for $250 a month. When OpenAI released ChatGPT in late 2022, Google was caught on the back foot and was forced to jump into higher gear to catch up. With this year’s product lineup, it looks as if Google has stuck its landing. On a preview call, CEO Sundar Pichai claimed that AI Overviews, a precursor to AI Mode that provides LLM-generated summaries of search results, had turned out to be popular with hundreds of millions of users. He speculated that many of them may not even know (or care) that they were using AI—it was just a cool new way to search. Google I/O gives a broader glimpse of that future, one where AI is invisible. “More intelligence is available, for everyone, everywhere,” Pichai told his audience. I think we are expected to marvel. But by putting AI in everything, Google is turning AI into a technology we won’t notice and may not even bother to name.","['Technology', 'Business', 'Finance']","Google's AI Takeover:  Invisible, Ubiquitous, and Utterly Unstoppable?
","Google is integrating its advanced AI models, including Imagen 4 and Veo 3, into its Gemini app, offering a single interface for accessing various generative AI features like live screen and camera interactions.  They're also launching AI Mode for search, incorporating personalized data and advanced search capabilities, aiming to seamlessly integrate AI into existing services.  This strategy, unlike OpenAI's more standalone approach, leverages Google's existing user base and ecosystem for a broader reach, making AI features subtly integrated rather than explicitly noticeable. ","Key insights and takeaways from the article:

* **Google's strategic shift from model power to product integration:**  The article highlights Google's focus on integrating its powerful AI models (like Gemini) into user-friendly products rather than solely emphasizing raw model performance.  This is presented as a key differentiator from competitors like OpenAI.

* **Gemini app as a central hub for multimodal AI:** Google is consolidating its various generative AI capabilities (image generation, video generation, etc.) within the Gemini app, providing a single access point for users.  This contrasts with a more fragmented approach from some competitors.

* **Seamless integration with existing Google services:** Leveraging its vast ecosystem of services (Search, Gmail, Docs), Google is embedding AI functionality directly into existing workflows, making AI less of a separate tool and more of an invisible assistant.  This is a major advantage over companies without established user bases and ecosystems.

* **Project Astra's progress towards consumer availability:** Features previously showcased only in demos of Google DeepMind's Project Astra (a universal AI assistant) are now being integrated into consumer products like Gemini, indicating progress towards a broader rollout.

* **AI Mode as a revolutionary search experience:**  AI Mode, incorporating features like Deep Search and Search Live, represents a significant upgrade to Google Search, using LLMs to personalize and streamline information retrieval.

* **Google's successful response to OpenAI's ChatGPT:** The article suggests that Google's initial hesitation in the face of ChatGPT's launch has been overcome, with its recent product releases demonstrating a strong comeback.  The success of AI Overviews (a precursor to AI Mode) is cited as evidence.

* **The future of AI: Invisible and ubiquitous:** Google's vision is presented as one where AI is seamlessly integrated into everyday life, becoming so ubiquitous that users may not even realize they're interacting with it.  This ""invisible AI"" approach is framed as a key strategic goal.

* **Premium access for power users:** The introduction of Google AI Ultra (a paid tier) caters to users demanding access to the latest and most advanced AI features.


In short, the article portrays Google as shifting its focus from a competition based solely on AI model capabilities to a race for the best *integration* of AI into everyday user experiences.  Its existing infrastructure and user base are positioned as key competitive advantages.

93,https://www.gim-international.com/content/article/innovative-technology-keeps-surveyors-safer-in-dutch-highway-reconstruction-project,Innovative technology keeps surveyors safer in Dutch highway reconstruction project,"The complex ‘Ring Zuid’ highway project in the Dutch city of Groningen illustrates the crucial role of advanced geospatial techniques in the infrastructure sector for design efficiency, execution accuracy and sustainable development. Advanced surveying techniques are indispenable in the infrastructure sector, where geospatial data holds the key to more efficient design, more accurate execution and more sustainable development. The recently completed ‘Ring Zuid’ highway project in Groningen, the biggest city in the north of the Netherlands, is a prime example of this. The aim was to reconstruct the southern ring road to improve accessibility, traffic flow, quality of life and safety in and around the city. Surveyors and site engineers from Geomaat were closely involved in the preparation, execution and completion of this project, which was one of the nation’s most complex infrastructure projects in recent years. Partly due to increasing traffic levels, the aim of the ‘Ring Zuid’ project (2019-2024, €927 million) was to reconstruct the southern ring road (the N7) on the outskirts of the Dutch city of Groningen to improve capacity and traffic flow. The existing road featured lots of traffic lights and junctions, which frequently resulted in congestion. Key components of the project were the conversion of the two biggest bottlenecks to grade-separated intersections, and the lowering and partial tunnelling of the N7. Specifically, the project included altering the trajectory of the road, constructing three tunnels and adapting a number of crossroads. This would reduce congestion and improve the accessibility of the city and surrounding area. At the same time, lowering the road and creating more green spaces would reduce noise pollution and improve the attractiveness of the urban landscape, thus improving the quality of life in the nearby neighbourhoods. Additionally, new infrastructural elements were developed for the local community. These included a tunnel for pedestrians and cyclists, and a safe cycle route that enabled cyclists to pass beneath the ring road without having to navigate busy junctions. These changes would not only improve road safety, but also enhance the immediate surroundings for local residents and businesses. Figure 1: The newly completed ring road in Groningen, opened after six years of construction. (Image courtesy: Sander van der Werf/Shutterstock). The role of surveying The surveyors and site engineers were crucial to the success of the ‘Ring Zuid’ project, from design to completion. Thanks to their adaptability, they played a big part in helping to solve complex challenges. Meanwhile, their proactive monitoring directly contributed to the quality, safety and efficiency of the project in a number of areas, including: Tunnel geometry precision: optimal concrete layer thanks to digital accuracy Surveyors were constantly involved in the various phases of constructing the tunnels. For example, they provided detailed 3D models of the tunnels, allowing engineers to determine the exact thickness of the concrete backfill layer before pouring. This accuracy was essential to correct deviations stemming from previous construction phases. In the dynamic environment, the surveyors used total stations to gather hundreds of reference points quickly, efficiently and error-free. This was essential to capture the unique tunnel shapes. It would not have been possible to complete the project on time and cost-efficiently without that data. Flexibility in the field: the right tool for every situation In each case, the surveyors selected the tools that suited the situation and the required level of accuracy. Whereas GPS was sufficient for general terrain measurements, total stations were the right choice for restricted tunnel environments. Whenever possible, the Streetmapper – Geomaat’s mobile 3D scanner solution – was used to acquire large volumes of data efficiently. However, traditional methods also came in useful, mainly in areas with no GPS signal or where poor access made it difficult to place scanners. Proactive monitoring: a safer environment The surveyors went beyond merely taking traditional measurements by also continuously monitoring environmental risks using innovative techniques. For instance, they kept track of: Compaction (using precision levelling and hundreds of facade anchors) Groundwater levels (using monitoring wells) Vibrations (using vibration sensors) Drainage (using measuring poles) This real-time data prevented surrounding buildings from becoming damaged and ensured that the construction work progressed safely. For example, the rapid detection of even the slightest subsidence allowed countermeasures to be taken immediately. Figure 2: Measurements and scans were triangulated into an accurate model for designers and engineers during the execution phase. Technologies for safer working During the 'Ring Zuid' project, specific protocols and methodologies were followed to ensure that the surveyors could collect data safely as well as efficiently. The Robotplotter and the Streetmapper were two technologies that played an important role in this. Robotplotter The Robotplotter, which can be operated remotely, allowed the surveyors to apply road markings without having to put themselves in the direct vicinity of the traffic. The Robotplotter can autonomously operate in a straight line guided by a global positioning system (GPS) or terrestrial positioning system (TPS), thus reducing the number of potentially dangerous situations. Richard Kainama (left), head of the surveying team at Geomaat, led a group of up to ten surveyors and three work planners. He played a key role in successfully delivering the 'Ring Zuid' project. ""I’m incredibly proud of our team, who give their all every day to help steer this massive project in the right direction,"" he says. (Image courtesy: Geomaat) Streetmapper The Streetmapper-IV is an advanced mobile 3D mapping system capable of scanning up to two million points per second with an accuracy of up to 5mm without interrupting the traffic flow. Thanks to Geomaat’s self-developed and continuously evolving artificial intelligence (AI) system, the Streetmapper not only automatically detects objects such as road markings, light poles, signs and guide rails, but also conducts a deeper layer of logical checks. The system then filters out moving objects (e.g. cars, cyclists and pedestrians), leaving only the static infrastructure, resulting in the near real-time transformation from point cloud to classified objects. Both these technologies improve the work of surveyors and site engineers by allowing them to capture more data more accurately, more efficiently and, above all, more safely. Additionally, the resulting data is reliable enough to be used as the basis for future analysis and comparisons. As a result, this approach not only shortens the amount of time spent in the field, but also reduces the need for return visits to conduct repeat measurements. Figure 3: Robotplotters work quickly, accurately and automously. This allows opertors to remain at a safe distance from the traffic. Conclusion Tackling Groningen’s southern ring road was a far-reaching infrastructure project. The aim was to have a lasting positive impact on both the city’s development and life in the local community by improving accessibility, traffic flow, liveability and safety in and around Groningen. These objectives were definitely achieved. Geomaat’s land surveyors and site engineers played a crucial role in the preparation, execution and completion of the project. Innovative technologies such as the Robotplotter and Streetmapper improved the efficiency and safety of the work. Major projects such as ‘Ring Zuid’ illustrate the growing need to not only build new infrastructure, but also to replace, renovate and reconstruct existing infrastructure. In future large-scale projects over the coming years, the lessons learned during ‘Ring Zuid’ will provide valuable knowledge in the areas of efficiency, safety and the added value of combining traditional land surveying with state-of-the-art mapping techniques. Objectives of the ‘Ring Zuid’ project Improving accessibility: Widening the ring road and modernizing the infrastructure to make it easier for motorists to reach their destinations. Traffic flow: Reducing the number of traffic lights and improving traffic conditions to ensure a smoother traffic flow, which also reduces journey times. Liveability: Reducing noise and air pollution in the vicinity of the ring road to improve liveability in the nearby neighbourhoods. Safety: To increase safety for both motorists and pedestrians with better infrastructure and fewer traffic lights. Richard Kainama, leader of the surveying team at Geomaat, led a team of up to ten surveyors and three work planners. The team’s tasks ranged from placing markers and mapping the environment using GPS, spirit levels and total stations, to performing both static scans and mobile ones using the Streetmapper. Geomaat took care that the design was a true representation of the environment and worked in close collaboration with MUG Ingenieursbureau (which has recently been acquired by Movares and will soon be known as Movares Smart Urban Engineering). Multiple engineering design firms were involved in the preparation and execution phases of the ‘Ring Zuid’ project. Among other things, Geomaat’s role was to perform checks and verify that the geometry of the designs was in line with the real-life situation.
